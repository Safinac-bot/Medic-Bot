CPAP. 
 
1. Assess scene for safety 
 
2. Use appropriate PPE

 ❶ 
 
7. If patient has an Unmanageable Airway (MCG 1302) 
Initiate immediate transport to the MAR and CONTACT BASE en route 
 
8. Assess for signs of trauma 
If traumatic injury suspected, treat in conjunction with TP 1244, Traumatic Injury 
 
9. For airway burns, treat in conjunction with TP 1220, Burns 
 
10. For suspected carbon monoxide exposure, treat in conjunction with TP 1238, Carbon Monoxide 
Poisoning 
 
11. For suspected exposure to hazardous materials including cyanide toxicity, treat in conjunction with 
TP 1240, HAZMAT 
 
12. For airway edema and/or stridor: 
Epinephrine (1mg/mL solution) administer 5mg (5mL) via neb 
Repeat x1 in 10 min prn  
 
13. For wheezing/bronchospasm (consider also for cough): 
Albuterol 5mg (6mL) via neb or 4 puffs via MDI  
Repeat x2 prn, maximum total dose prior to Base contact 15mg 
 
14. Initiate CPAP for alert patients with moderate or severe respiratory distress  
  Hold CPAP for patients with hypotension, suspected pneumothorax, upper airway 
edema/obstruction, or other contraindications (MCG 1315) ❷

18. For poor perfusion (MCG 1355): 
Normal Saline 1L IV rapid infusion

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶ Suspect smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide exposure in setting of closed-space fires, 
carbonaceous sputum in mouth/nose, elevated carbon monoxide levels (if point of care testing 
available), and facial burns. For patients with ALOC or seizure after industrial or closed space fire, 
also consider cyanide toxicity; contact Base and ensure notification of the receiving hospital.  
 
❷ CPAP is appropriate for undifferentiated respiratory distress and may be used if patient does not 
improve after initial albuterol.
