Shifts potassium intracellular. Has mild beta-1 activity with mild effect on heart rate. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset 5-15 min inhaled, Duration 3-6 hours for bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, Duration 3-4 hours for 
hyperkalemia shifting potassium intracellular 
 
Contraindications 
Do not use for patients with a known hypersensitivity/allergy to the drug

Prehospital Considerations 
• Young children 2-6 years old may be more prone to adverse effects 
• Don’t assume patients have administered their own drug properly. Do not include home doses of 
albuterol in your total drug administration consideration. 
• Administration via MDI with spacer is typically required for this route to be effective in novice users. 
• MDIs are single use and should be left with the hospital staff upon handoff of the patient.
