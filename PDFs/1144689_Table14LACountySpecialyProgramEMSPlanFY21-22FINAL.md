ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 
The input o
f the Hospital Association of Southern California’s (HASC) Emergency Health 
Services Committee and the Cardiac Technical Advisory Group (TAG) was essential in the 
initial development of these standards.  The TAG was composed of a cardiologist from the 
American Heart Association; Emergency Department physicians from teaching and community 
hospitals; an EMS Commissioner; nurse managers from emergency departments and 
catheterization labs; members of the Association of Prehospital Care Coordinators; a Paramedic 
Nurse Educator; and the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency.  Additional contributions 
were made by the Medical Council of the EMS Agency, the Commission, the American Heart 
Association and the Los Angeles County Medical Association.

EFFECTIVE: 09-01-16 PAGE 1   OF 2 
REVISED: 01-01-22 
SUPERSEDES: 10-01-20 
APPROVED:   ________________________ ______________________________ 
Director, EMS Agency Medical Director, EMS Agency 
AUTHORITY: California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 7.1 
PRINCIPLES: 
1.Targeted temperature management (TTM) preserves cerebral function in patients
resuscitated after cardiac arrest. This occurs through decreasing cellular metabolism
and oxygen demand, reducing production of excitatory neurotransmitters, minimizing
disruption of ion homeostasis, and reducing free radicals.
2.Previ
ously referred to as “therapeutic hypothermia”, the term TTM has been adopted to
refer to either induced hypothermia or strict temperature control at a target core
temperature at or below normothermia (32-37.5
o
C) for at least 24 hours.
3.Current
 guidelines recommend that all comatose adult patients with return of
spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest have TTM for both shockable and
non-shockable rhythms.
4.Whil
e there are no data demonstrating a benefit of therapeutic hypothermia in children
who remain comatose after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, these children with ROSC may
benefit from TTM with target temperatures between 36 and 37.5°C.
5.Initi
ating hypothermia in the prehospital setting has not improved survival or neurologic
outcomes. Currently there is no role for prehospital cooling.
6.Fever in t
he post-cardiac arrest patient is associated with poor outcome.
7.TTM is
 the only intervention demonstrated to improve neurological recovery after cardiac
arrest. TTM should not affect the decision to perform percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI). Concurrent PCI and hypothermia are reported to be feasibly safe.
GUIDELI
NES: 
1.Fever should be avoided in all comatose post-cardiac arrest pediatric and adult patients.
2.Comatose adult (greater than 14 years of age) patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest
should receive TTM.
3.There are no absolute contraindications for TTM; however, it is reasonable to withhold
TMM in the following scenarios:
a.Known wishes for limitations in resuscitation and/or a Do Not Resuscitate-order
b.Known com
orbid disease making 180 days survival unlikely
Attachment 1-D

SUBJECT: TARGETED TEMPERATURE 
MANAGEMENT GUIDELINE REFERENCE NO. 320.1 
c.Preceding poor neurologic function (Pre-arrest Cerebral Performance Category
of 3 or 4)
d.Tem
perature on admission <30°C
4.A temperature between 32°C and 37.5°C should be selected and maintained for at least
24 hours once target temperature is achieved. Core temperature should be monitored.
Axillary or oral temperatures are inadequate for measurement of core temperature.
5.Targets below 36°C should typically be avoided for the following conditions:
a.Pregnancy
b.Known intrinsic bleeding diathesis (e.g. hemophilia or Von Willebrand)
c.Acute intracranial bleeding and/or major head trauma
d.Active significant bleeding
e.Suspected or confirmed acute stroke
f.Systolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg despite fluid resuscitation, vasopressor(s)
and possibly including inotropic medication and/or intra-aortic balloon pump
g.Delays longer than 6 hours from ROSC to cooling
6.TTM may be achieved and maintained using:
a.Intravenous Normal Saline 4°C
b.Ice packs (axillae, groin, neck)
c.Cooling blankets
d.Cooling vests
e.Intravascular devices (including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)

SPECIAL CONSID
ERATIONS
 
❶If LAMS is 4 or greater, place 18 gauge IV if possible to facilitate advanced imaging studies at CSC.
❷The Modified LAPSS (mLAPSS) is a validated tool that helps to identify stroke mimics and excludes
patients that will not benefit from stroke care. Using a stroke scale, such as mLAPSS, increases the
chances of diagnosing strokes. However, stroke scales do not catch all strokes, including
presentations such as aphasia, ataxia and vertigo. For patients in whom you suspect stroke but are
mLAPSS negative, calculate the LAMS and contact the Base to discuss the destination decision.
History of prior stroke does not exclude the need to evaluate for possible new deficits.
 New findings
in a patient 
with prior stroke should be managed similarly to first-time strokes and su
ch patients
should be ro
uted to the closest appropriate approved stroke 
center per Ref. 521.
❸In patients with suspected stroke, the LAMS is performed by verbally requesting movement of face,
arm, and grip or, if the patient is aphasic, by non-verbally encouraging such movement via pantomime
and/or by gentle placement of limbs (painful 
stimulation is avoided). In patients with suspected 
stroke
with ALOC (e.g., GCS <9) attempt neurologic assessment as noted 
above; alternatively, for 
patients
unable to pe
rform movements, compare tone and strength th
rough passive movement of the limbs.
❹ LKWT determines the patient’s eligibility for TPA and/or interventional procedures for clot removal.
Document the name and contact inf
ormation of the family member, caregiver, or witness who ca
n
verify the pa
tient’s LKWT and report this information to ED providers. If possible, tran
sport the
witness with
 the patient.
❺Whenever possible transport patients with suspected stroke with head of bed elevated 30-45
degrees. This reduces risk of aspiration and also reduces elevation in intracranial pressure.

SU
BJECT: SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE/NEGLECT EMT-1, PARAMEDIC, MICN 
REPORTING GUIDELINES REFERENCE NO. 822 
PURPOSE: To provide guidelines and procedures for prehospital care personnel to report 
suspected child abuse. 
AUTHORITY: California Penal Code, Chapter 916, Sections 11164-11174.3 
County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services 
DEFINITIONS: 
Agencies authorized to accept mandated reports: Any police department or sheriff’s 
department, and the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) Child 
Protection Hotline (CPH). School district police and security departments are not 
authorized to accept reports. 
C
hild: Any person less than eighteen years of age. 
M
andated reporter: Any healthcare practitioner, child care custodian, or an employee 
of a child protective agency. This includes EMTs and paramedics. 
N
eglect: The negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child by a person responsible for 
the child’s welfare under circumstances indicating harm or threatened harm to the child’s 
health or welfare. The term includes both acts and omissions on the part of the 
responsible person. 
P
hysical abuse: Physical injury or death inflicted by other than accidental means upon 
a child by another person. 
S
exual abuse: Sexual assault or the exploitation of a minor. Sexual assault includes, 
but is not limited to, any intrusion by one person into the genitals; anal opening of a 
child; oral copulation intentional touching for the purposes of sexual arousal or 
gratification, or masturbation in the presence of a child. Sexual exploitation includes 
conduct involving matters depicting minors engaged in obscene acts; and/or prostitution. 
PR
INCIPLES: 
1.The purpose of reporting suspected child abuse/neglect is to protect the child,
prevent further abuse of the child and other children in the home, and to facilitat
e
t
reatment for the entire family. The presence of abuse, rather than the degree of
that abuse, is the determinant for intervention by DCFS and law enforcement.
2.California Penal Code, Sections 11166 and 11168, require mandated reporters to
pr
omptly report all suspected non-accidental injuries, sexual abuse, or neglect of
children that they suspect, have knowledge of, or observe in their professional
capacity. A verbal report shall be made to DCFS Child Protection Hotline

immediately, or as soon as practically possible, and the Suspected Child Abuse 
Report shall be completed within 36 hours. 
I
n Los Angeles County, it is recommended that a report be made to local law 
enforcement as well. 
3.It  is not necessary for the mandated reporter to determine child abuse but only to
s
uspect that it may have occurred. Law enforcement, DCFS and the courts
determine whether child abuse/neglect has, in fact, occurred.
4.Current law mandates (CPC 11166) all healthcare professionals to report
suspected child abuse/neglect that they know of or observe in their professional
capacity. Mandated reporters are required to sign a statement
acknowledging their understanding of the law (See Ref. No. 822.3, Sampl
e
E
mployee Acknowledgement as a Mandated Reporter). Any person who fails to
report as required may be punished by a fine or imprisonment.
5.When a mandated reporter suspects or has observed child abuse/neglect, that
individual is required to report by telephone to local law enforcement and/or to
DCFS Child Protection Hotline.
6.When two or more mandated reporters are present at scene and jointly know or
suspect an instance of child abuse/neglect, a member of the reporting team may
be designated to report on behalf of the team. Any member who knows that the
designated reporter failed to uphold their agreement shall thereafter make the
report. If paramedics are not selected as the designated reporters, they shall
document the name and agency of the designated reporting team member on th
e
E
MS Report Form.
7.Persons legally required to report suspected child abuse are immune from
criminal or civil liability for reporting as required.
POLICY: 
I.Reporting Procedure
A.Notify local law enforcement immediately if a child is suspected to be in imminent
danger. Prehospital care providers should be aware of their local law
enforcement reporting procedures and telephone numbers for notification.
B.Call the 24-hour Child Protection Hotline at (800) 540-4000 as soon as possible
to make the verbal report. (Refer to 822.1 for reporting options and instructions).

SPECIAL CO
NSIDERATIONS 
❶In pediatric patients with hypoglycemia consider causes such as medication error or medication given
without appropriate oral i
ntake, infection, or toxins
. Survey scene and ask family for types of
medications in the home including 
those in various forms (e.g., pill, patch, drops, salves, inhaled
 or
herbal). Caretakers of p
ediatric patients should always be encouraged to have patient be transpo
rted
to the hospit
al for evaluation as hypoglycemia in this population is rare as compared to adults and
 is
often cause
d by serious disease or poisonings. Glucagon may not work well in youn
g infants
because in t
hese patients there are few glycogen stores, therefore IV dextrose is pref
erred.
❷Pediatric patients with hypoglycemia who are successfully treated with oral glucose or Dextrose 10%
IV and then their parent wishes to decline transport to the hospital should be discouraged to do so,
especially if they have abnormal vital signs, fever, are taking long acting hypoglycemic agents
possible ingestion or poisoning, or if they DO NOT have a history of diabetes mellitus as these
patients are 
at high risk for recurrent hypoglycemic episode
s.
Long Acting 
hypoglycemi
c agents
Sulfonylureas: gliclazide, glimepiride, glipizide, gliquidone, glyburide, glyclopyramide,
Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), troglitazone
(Rezulin)
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: acarbose, miglitol, voglibose
Meglitinides – nateglinide, repaglinide
Combination drugs: glipizide and metformin (Metaglip), glyburide and 
metformin
(Glucovance), pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact), pioglitazone and metformin (ACTOplus
Met), rosiglitazone and metformin (Avandamet), rosiglitazone and glimepiride (Avandaryl)
❸ Patients with hyperglycemia are at risk for significant volume losses leading to dehydration and
electrolyte abnormalities. Fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline is recommended until their glucose
can be lowered with medications. Hyperglycemia can also be associated with trauma, infection, or
other seriou
s illness. For patients with elevated glucose requiring fluids IV Normal Saline should
 be
given – onl
y those patients who show signs of poor perfusion and an IV cannot be ob
tained would
have an IO placed for fl
uid resuscitation.

SPECIAL C
ONSIDERATIONS 
❶Epinephrine is the drug of choice for allergic reactions with any angioedema, respiratory compromise
or poor perfusion. It should be given IM into a large muscle group, lateral thigh preferred or
alternatively the lateral gluteus. Vital signs vary by age and normal ranges can be found in MCG
1309.  Any pediatric patient with vital signs outside the normal range for age should be considered
potentially ill and transported to an EDAP or PMC if criteria are met.
❷Patients with wheezing due to allergic reaction should be treated with Epinephrine IM. Albuterol may
be administered in addition to Epinephrine IM if wheezing persists.
❸Consider blow-by to avoid agitation in pediatric patients if a mask cannot be tolerated (e.g., infants
and toddlers).
❹ Diphenhydramine does not treat anaphylaxis. For patients in anaphylaxis, Epinephrine administration
is the first priority. Diphenhydramine may be considered once other treatments are complete or in
stable patients with discomfort for isolated hives.

Treatment Protocol: SUBMERSION Ref. No. 1225-P 
REVISED: 10

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶Cardiac arrest from drowning should be treated per TP 1210-P, Cardiac Arrest. Ventilation is
particularly important as the cardiac arrest is almost always due to respiratory failure. In cases of cold
water drowning follow usual protocols for resuscitation while simultaneously rewarming the patient.
Patients with hypothermia due to cold water drowning, may have good neurologic outcome despite
prolonged resuscitation; resuscitative efforts should continue until the patient is rewarmed.
Consultation with the Base Physician is required before consideration of termination of resuscitation
in patients with suspected hypothermia.
❷Decompression illness includes arterial gas embolism from barotrauma and decompression
sickness (aka “the bends”) due to dissolved nitrogen in the blood coming out of solution.
Decompression illness most frequently occurs in scuba divers after breathing compressed air at
depth. While arterial gas embolism presents almost immediately after ascent, decompression
sickness is often delayed and should be considered in any patient with symptoms (e.g. respiratory
distress, ALOC, chest or body pain) within 24 hours of completing a dive. All patients with possible
decompression illness need immediate evaluation for possible hyperbaric treatment. Per Ref. 518,
contact Base immediately to discuss.
❸
Warming measures should include moving the patient to  a warm environment as quickly as possible,
removing wet clothing/items, covering with an emergency/rescue blanket or other blankets/sheets,
and using warm Normal Saline if available.
❹
Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat.
❺Rales may be present in patients after submersion/drowning due to direct lung injury and/or
aspiration of water. This is not an indication of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (such as from
congestive heart failure), which is extremely rare in children, and does not prohibit administration of
IV fluids. IV fluids should be initiated and continued unless respiratory status worsens during
administration.
❻ EMS is assisting the Department of Public Health (DPH) in promptly investigating fatal or nonfatal
drownings at public pools or spas in order to ensure safety can be verified before reopening.
Contacting the on-call DPH officer will allow timely investigation of these incidents and prevent future
incidents.

for health care to make health care decisions for the patient, also known as “attorney-in-fact”. 
Aid-in-Dy
ing Drug: A drug determined and prescribed by a physician for a qualified individual, 
which the qualified individual may choose to self-administer to bring about his or her death due 
to terminal illness. The prescribed drug may take effect within minutes to several days after 
self-administration. 
Conserv
ator: Court-a ppointed authority to make health care decisions for a patient. 
Determination of Death: To conclude that a patient has died by conducting an assessment to 
confirm the absence of respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic function. 
End of L
ife Option Act: This California state law authorizes an adult, eighteen years or older, 
who meets certain qualifications, and who has been determined by his or her attending 
physician to be suffering from a terminal disease to make a request for an “aid-in-dying drug” 
prescribed for the purpose of ending his or her life in a humane and dignified manner.

PRI
NCIPLES: 
1.Resuscitative efforts are of no benefit to patients whose physical condition precludes any
possibility of successful resuscitation.
2.EMTs and paramedics may determine death based on specific criteria set forth in this
policy.
3.Base hospital physicians may pronounce death based on information provided by the
paramedics in the field and guidelines set forth in this policy.
4.If there is any objection or disagreement by family members or EMS personnel regarding
terminating or withholding resuscitation, basic life support (BLS) resuscitation, including
defibrillation, may continue or begin immediately and paramedics should contact the base
hospital for further directions.
5.Aggressive resuscitation in the field to obtain the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
is encouraged. Transporting patients without ROSC is discouraged.
6.EMS  personnel  should  honor  valid  do-not-resuscitate  (DNR)  orders  and  other  patient
designated  end-of-life  directives  in  the  field  and  act  in  accordance  with  the  patient’s
wishes when death appears imminent.
POLICY: 
I.EMS personnel may determine death in the following circumstances:
A.In addition to the absence of respiration, cardiac activity, and neurologic reflexes,
one or more of the following physical or circumstantial conditions exist:
1.Decapitation
2.Massive crush injury

insufficient medical resources preclude initiating resuscitative measures.
10.Drowning victims, when it is reasonably determined that submersion has
been greater than one hour.
11.Rigor mortis (requires assessment as described in Section I, B.)
12.Post-mortem lividity (requires assessment as described in Section I, B.)
B.If the initial assessment reveals rigor mortis and/or post-mortem lividity only, EMTs
and/or paramedics shall perform the following assessments (may be performed
concurrently) to confirm the absence of respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic
function for determination of death in the field:
1.Assessment of respiratory status:
a.Assure that the patient has an open airway.
b.Look, listen and feel for respirations. Auscultate the lungs for  a
minimum of 30 seconds to confirm apnea.
2.Assessment of cardiac status:
a.Auscultate the apical pulse for a minimum of 60 seconds to confirm
the absence of heart sounds.
b.Adults and children: Palpate the carotid pulse for a minimum of 60
seconds to confirm the absence of a pulse.

determine if pupils are fixed and dilated.
b.Check and confirm unresponsive to pain stimuli.
C.Patients in atraumatic cardiopulmonary arrest who do not meet the conditions
described in Section I. A. require immediate BLS measures to be initiated. If one
or more of the following conditions is met, resuscitation may be discontinued and
the patient is determined to be dead:
1.A valid standardized patient-designated directive indicating DNR.
2.A valid AHCD with written DNR instructions or the agent identified in the
AHCD requesting no resuscitation.
3.Immediate family member present at scene:

family requesting no resuscitation, and EMS providers concur
4.Parent or legal guardian is required and must be present at scene to
withhold or terminate resuscitation for patients less than 18 years of age.
II.Patients in atraumatic cardiopulmonary arrest who do not meet the conditions described
in Section I require immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in accordance with Ref.
No. 1210, Treatment Protocol: Cardiac Arrest. Base contact for medical direction shall
be established when indicated by Ref. No. 1210.
A.EMS Personnel may determine death if a patient is in asystole after 20 minutes
of quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation on scene and meets ALL of the following
criteria:
1.Patient 18 years or greater
2.Arrest not witnessed by EMS personnel
3.No shockable rhythm identified at any time during the resuscitation
4.No ROSC at any time during the resuscitation

met. 
C.Base Physician contact shall be established to guide resuscitation and to make
decisions regarding timing of transport, if transport is indicated, for all patients
in cardiopulmonary arrest who do not meet the conditions described in Section I
or IIA of this policy.
D.In the event that immediate family members on scene request termination of
resuscitation after resuscitation is in progress,  and the patient does not meet
criteria in section IIA, base physician consultation shall be made for termination
and pronouncement. This does not apply to brief initiation of CPR while
establishing patient/family wishes as per I.C.3.
III.Physician guidelines for transport versus termination
A.Resuscitation should be continued on-scene until one of the following:
1.ROSC is confirmed with a palpable pulse and corresponding rise in EtCO
2
Par
amedics should stabilize the patient on scene after ROSC (for
approximately 5 minutes) per TP 1210 and initiate transport once ROSC is
maintained.
2.Base physician determines further resuscitative efforts are futile
B.Patients who have NOT maintained ROSC after on-scene resuscitation and
stabilization should NOT be transported unless the Base physician determines
transport is indicated.
1.Early transport for patients with ongoing resuscitation is    NOT advised.
2.The decision to transport a patient with refractory OHCA should be based
on the availability of therapies at the receiving center that are not available
on scene.
IV.Crime Scene Responsibility, Including Presumed Accidental Deaths and Suspected
Suicides
A.Responsibility for medical management rests with the most medically qualified
person on scene.
B.Authority for crime scene management shall be vested in law enforcement.  To
access the patient, it may be necessary to ask law enforcement officers for
assistance to create a “safe path” that minimizes scene contamination.
C.If law enforcement is not on scene, EMS personnel should attempt to create a
"safe path" and secure the scene until law enforcement arrives.
V.Procedures Following Pronouncement of Death
A.The deceased should not be moved without the coroner’s authorization. Any
invasive equipment (i.e., intravenous line, endotracheal tube) used on the patient
Attachment 4-C

SUBJECT: DETERMINATION /   PRONOUNCEMENT REFERENCE NO. 814 
OF DEATH IN THE FIELD 
PAGE 6
 OF 7 
should be left in place. 
NO
TE:    If it is necessary to move the deceased because the scene is 
unsafe, the body is creating a hazard, or the body is at risk of loss 
through fire or flood, the EMS personnel may relocate the 
deceased to a safer location,  or transport to the most accessible 
receiving facility. 
B.If law enforcement or the coroner confirms that the deceased will not be a
coroner’s case and the personal physician is going to sign the death certificate,
any invasive equipment used during the resuscitation may be removed.
C.EMS personnel should remain on scene until law enforcement arrives.  During
this time, when appropriate, the provider should provide grief support to family
members.
VI.Required Documentation for Patients Determined Dead/Pronounced in the Field
A.The time and criteria utilized to determine death; the condition, location and
position of the body, and any care provided.
B.The location and the rationale if the deceased was moved. If the coroner
authorized movement of the deceased, document the coroner's case number (if
available) and the coroner’s representative who authorized the movement.
C.Time of pronouncement and name of the pronouncing physician if base hospital
contact was initiated
D.The name of the agent identified in the AHCD or patient-designated directive or
the name of the immediate family member who made the decision to withhold or
withdraw resuscitative measures. Obtain their signature on the EMS Report Form.
E.If the deceased is not a coroner’s case and their personal physician is going to
sign the death certificate:
1.Document the name of the coroner’s representative who authorized
release of the patient, and
2.The name of the patient’s personal physician signing the death certificate,
and
3.Any invasive equipment removed
VII.End of Life Option Act
A.Resuscitation shall be withheld on patients in cardiopulmonary arrest who have
self-administered an aid-in-dying drug (see Ref. No. 815.4, End of Life Option
Field Quick Reference Guide).
B.Document the presence of a Final Attestation and attach a copy if available.
