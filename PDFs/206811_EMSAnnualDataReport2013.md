data  in  managing  our  system  
and optimizing patient care. 
 
GOAL   2   -   Highlight   the   detri-
mental  impact  of  data  gaps  on  
our  ability  to  make  data  driven  
decisions   and   the   limitations   
they  place  on  evaluating  quality  
and outcomes of patient care. 
 
GOAL  3  -  Document  how  the  
EMS   system   design   improves   
patient  outcome  and  parallels  
the   healthcare   needs   of   the   
community  and  addresses  the  
leading   causes   of   death   and   
disability  (heart  attack,  stroke,  
and trauma) in Los Angeles. 
 
We   would   like   to   thank   the   
Board  of  Supervisors,  Dr.  Mitch  
Katz,   Director   of   the   Depart-
ment of Health Services and the 
EMS Commission for their ongo-
ing support of the system.  Most 
significantly  we  need  to  thank  
Richard  Tadeo  for  his  efforts  in  
compiling   and   designing   this   
comprehensive report.  
The  EMS  Agency’s  is  charged  with  
the coordination of the Emergency 
Medical  System  for  Los  Angeles  
County,  one  of  the  busiest  and  
largest  systems  in  the  nation.  Co-
ordination  of  the  system  ensures  
that   a   person   calling   9-1-1   re-
ceives  uniformly  high  quality  care  
and  transport  to  the  appropriate  
hospital,  from  the  ocean  to  the  
mountains  and  desert.  The  geo-
graphic  size  and  complexity  make  
this  a  difficult  task  yet  effectively  
managed due to 
the     dedication     
of  thousands  of  
our EMS person-
nel      working      
around      the      
clock  to  provide  
quality care. 
 
Since   its   inception   
in  the  early  1970’s,  as  one  of  the  
first  providers  of  paramedic  ser-
vices,   the   County   officials   and   
consultants   recognized   the   im-
portance  of  data  in  systems  man-
agement.    Our  current  data  base  
contains  over  12  million  patient  
records,  processed  through  hard  
copy and hand entered into a com-
puter  data  system.    Over  600,000  
patient    care    records    are    pro-
cessed    each    year    with    little    
change      since      
1970.    Techno-
logical  advances  
and    healthcare    
reform   are   rap-
idly  leading  EMS    
from    a    paper    
based  system  to  
electronic.    While    
it  may  take  sever-
al  years  for  the  complete  transi-
tion,  we  are  already  seeing  posi-
tive  effects  from  the  rapid  trans-
mission  of  our  data.    Without  a  
robust  and  real  time  data,  man-
agement  of  our  system  is  always  
playing   “catch”   up   with   system   
wide events. 
  
Our  goals  for  this  report  continue  
to be: 
 
GOAL  1  -  Provide  EMS  data  to  our  
participants,   encourage   them   to   
recognize  the  importance  of  their

EMS SYSTEM REPORT 
Most Prevalent Trauma Center Criteria/Guidelines 
Throughout it’s 30-year history in Los Angeles County, The Trauma System has revised its criteria and 
standards  to  ensure  that  injured  patients  requiring  the  care  of  a  trauma  center  are  appropriately  
triaged  and  transported.    While  some  criteria  were  retired  (i.e.,  Abnormal  Capillary  Refill,  No  
Spontaneous Eye Opening, Precarious Medical History), new standards were added (i.e., Blunt Head 
with  a  Glasgow  Coma  Scale  less  than  or  equal  to  14,  Paramedic  Judgment).    The  most  recent  
changes to the trauma center criteria and guidelines  were implemented in July 2012 to align more 
closely  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.    These  
recommendations  were  published  in  its  Morbidity  and  Mortality  Weekly  Report:  Guidelines  for  Field  
Triage of Injured Patients—Recommendations of the National Expert Panel on Field Triage.  The EMS 
Agency continually evaluates the impact of these changes to the system.

ASC Diversion 
The “at patient to ED arrival”  time when the 
ASC is the closest facility is generally 1-4 
minutes shorter compared to incidents in 
which the paramedics by-pass a closer 
hospital that is not a verified primary stroke 
center.  This is attributed to the abundance of 
ASCs in LA County.   Forty-four percent (n=32) 
of the 911 receiving hospitals in LA County are 
Approved Stroke Centers.
