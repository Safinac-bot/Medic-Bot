This  is  the  6
th
 edition  of  the  Los  Angeles  County 
EMS  Agency  Annual  Data  Report.  The  purpose  of 
this report is to educate the community on the EMS 
System  components,  provide  transparency  of  our 
performance,  which  in  turn  leads  to  continuous 
improvement.   We   provide   important,   descriptive 
data of our system including EMS transports to 
9-1-1  receiving  hospitals  as 
well  as  to  our  specialty  care 
centers     including     Trauma 
Centers,   ST   Elevation   Myo-
cardial     Infarction     (STEMI) 
Receiving    Centers,    Stroke 
Centers,  and  Pediatric  Trau-
ma Centers. 
The EMS  Agency  and constit-
uent groups are committed 
to  improving  the outcome  for 
patients  suffering  from  myo-
cardial infarction and cardiac 
arrest.    Ensuring  the  strong 
links  in  the  “chain  of  survival”  by  organizing  the 
annual SideWalk CPR with the EMS providers teach-
ing   thousands   of   participant   hands   only   CPR 
throughout  LA  County,  working  with  law  enforce-
ment  to  carry  Automatic  Defibrillators,  to  designat-
ing and monitoring our  STEMI system, of which, we 
recently  celebrated  the  10 year  anniversary.   Using 
these  data  we  work  with  our   STEMI  Advisory  Com-
mittee  to  provide  ongoing  quality  improvement  ac-
tivities and improve  our  STEMI service to the Coun-
ty. With 35 STEMI Centers, patients have access to 
these services no matter where you are in the Coun-
ty.  Each  of  the  STEMI  Centers  are  also  Cardiac  Ar-
rest   Centers  receiving  those   patients   who   have 
return  of a heart  beat  after  treatment in  the  field.  The 
goal  of  which  is  to  train  the  entire  population  to  truly 
affect  cardiac  arrest  outcome.    This  is  an  important 
change that has  occurred in our system over time  and 
allows  for  advanced  therapies  to  treat  patients  who 
would  have  otherwise  died  in  the  field  without  this 
care.  
Our  Stroke  System  has  grown  considerably  with  49 
approved  stroke  centers  within  the  County.  We  have 
been  working  with  various  stakeholders  in  our  County 
to  develop  further  regionalization  of  stroke  care  to 
Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSC) for those patients 
for  which clot removal  could  significantly improve  their 
outcome.  We  will  be  able  to 
collect  data  on  these  patients 
over time and provide addition-
al insights that can improve the 
lives    of    our    patients    with 
stroke.   With   the   49   Stroke 
Centers   and   the   soon-to-be 
designated     Comprehensive 
Stroke  Centers,  we  anticipate 
rapid  access  to  Stroke  Center 
care  throughout  the  County 
of Los Angeles.  
Overall,  the  LA  County  EMS 
system    has    continued    to 
grow  and  mature  through  the  use  of  quality  data  and 
outcomes  to  drive  the  system  performance.    We  have 
come  a  long  way  from  providing  minimal  interventions 
in the field to providing more complex  proven care that 
improves  patient  outcome,  shortens  length  of  hospital 
stay,  and  recognized  the  needs  of  the  individual  and 
their  families.  We  are  proud to  present  our  6
th
 Annual 
Report to you.

Hospitals have requested diver-
sion  of  paramedic  units  from  a 
low  of  1.5  hrs/day/hospital  in 
1995 to a high of 6.5 hrs/day/
hospital   in   2005.      Diversion 
policies  were  revised  to  miti-
gate   the   increasing  diversion 
problem which has stabilized in 
the last 10 years to an average 
of 2.3 hrs/day/hospital. 
However,   ED   overcrowding   is 
now  being  manifested  in  pro-
longed    Ambulance    Patient 
Offload Times (APOT).  The EMS 
Agency will be publishing APOT 
reports in the future as data on 
APOT collection becomes more 
consistent and  timely.
