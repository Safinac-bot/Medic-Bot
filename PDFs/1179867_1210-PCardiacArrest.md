SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

❶   EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
 when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to accepting 
ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkept home, evidence of drug 
or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or suspected domestic violence), when the history 
does not match with the severity of physical findings (e.g., child posturing after a roll off the couch), 
when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, whip marks on the 
skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. Children < 3 years 
of age and those with developmental delay are at increased risk of abuse. This must also be 
accompanied by notification to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). 
 
❷    Maintaining perfusion with high-quality CPR throughout resuscitation is essential to ensuring 
      good patient outcome. Chest compressions are the most important aspect of cardiac arrest  
      resuscitation. Maintaining chest compressions should take priority over any medication  
      administration or transport. Transporting the patient in cardiac arrest causes interruptions in CPR and  
      reduces CPR quality. Similar to adults in OHCA, pediatric patients who are resuscitated on scene  
      have higher neurologically intact survival. Transport may be initiated sooner if scene safety concerns. 
 
❸  Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with a viral filter is the preferred initial method of airway management for 
pediatric patients.  BMV in cardiac arrest has been associated with improved patient outcomes; the 
role of the supraglottic airway (SGA) in pediatric patients is still unknown. SGA placement should be 
performed if BMV is ineffective and otherwise deferred until initial resuscitation priorities are complete 
(i.e., at least 2 defibrillations for shockable rhythms and first dose of epinephrine IV for nonshockable 
rhythms). Sizing of the SGA per MCG 1309. When authorized, intubation should not be performed 
until after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) unless ventilation with BMV and SGA is 
ineffective and/or contraindicated. 
 
❹    Hyperventilation reduces venous return and worsens patient outcomes. Both continuous and 
interrupted (15:2) compressions/ventilations are acceptable. Regardless of ventilation method used, 
ventilations should be no more frequent than 10 per minute with a volume just enough to see chest 
rise and then release the bag to allow for exhalation (“squeeze, release, release”). Once ROSC is 
achieved ventilation rates can increase to 20 per minute.  
 
❺ Children < 3 years of age are at high risk for foreign body aspiration. Foreign body aspiration should 
be suspected if there is a history of possible aspiration or when there is no chest rise with BMV after 
repositioning of the airway.  
 
❻     EMS personnel should remain on scene up to 20 minutes to establish chest compressions, vascular 
access and epinephrine administration for nonshockable rhythms or until return of spontaneous 
circulation (ROSC) is achieved; for shockable rhythms, remain on scene until 3 defibrillations or until 
ROSC is achieved. The best results occur when resuscitation is initiated and maintained on scene, 
and post ROSC care is initiated. 
 
❼ If you are able to observe the underlying rhythm during compressions via rhythm display technology, 
do not pause for the rhythm check. 
 
❽    ETCO
2
 should be > 10 with a “box-shaped” waveform during effective CPR. A flat or wavy waveform 
or ETCO
2
 < 10 may indicate ineffective compressions or airway obstruction. A sudden increase in 
ETCO
2
 is suggestive of ROSC. The waveform can also be used to confirm ventilation rate if an 
advanced airway or asynchronous ventilation with continuous compressions is used.

❾    Peripheral venous access may be difficult to obtain in infants and small children. Consider IO 
placement as primary vascular access in patients for whom venous access is unlikely to be achieved 
rapidly. For older children, make two attempts at venous access and, if unsuccessful, place and IO 
for vascular access. 
 
❿ Epinephrine may improve outcomes if given early in nonshockable rhythms and should be given 
within 5 minutes of the resuscitation. For shockable rhythms, where defibrillation is the preferred 
initial treatment, epinephrine should be given after the second defibrillation. Epinephrine is most likely 
to be effective if it is given early and after chest compressions have begun. The likelihood of 
meaningful survival declines after three (3) doses of epinephrine.  Resuscitation should continue 
focused on quality CPR, defibrillation, and identifying reversible causes. Additional doses of 
epinephrine should only be administered with Base order if indicated, based on the individual patient.  
 
⓫ Potential causes that can be treated in the field include hypoxia, hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, 
hypothermia, toxins, and tension pneumothorax. Hypoxia and Hypovolemia are common causes of 
PEA arrest in children. Hypoglycemia is a very rare cause of cardiac arrest and should not be 
assessed until after ROSC.  
 
⓬   Changing the pad position, called vector change, from anterior-lateral to anterior-posterior or vice 
versa in patients who do not respond to initial defibrillation attempts, increases the chances of 
converting to a perfusing rhythm. 
 
⓭ Re-arrest shortly after ROSC is common. Early indicators of impending re-arrest include falling EtCO
2
 
and progressive bradycardia. Initiate post-resuscitation care prior to transport, if the scene allows, in 
order to reduce chances of re-arrest en route. Fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and 
avoidance of hyperventilation are recommended to decrease the risk of re-arrest. Transport 
considerations include suspected cause of arrest and anticipated transport time to a Pediatric 
Medical Center. Pediatric patients with ROSC should be transported to a Pediatric Medical Center if 
within 30 minutes. 
 
⓮    ETCO
2
 can help guide your ventilation rate; target ETCO
2
 35-45 mmHg. Just after ROSC, the ETCO
2
 
may be transiently elevated. This will decrease appropriately with ventilation and does not require 
hyperventilation to normalize. Persistently elevated ETCO
2
 and/or “sharkfin” waveform may indicate 
respiratory failure as cause of the cardiac arrest. Falsely low ETCO
2
 measurements can occur if 
there is a leak with BMV or shock. 
  
⓯ Push-dose Epinephrine is appropriate for non-traumatic shock including cardiogenic shock.  
Additional doses beyond 10mL may need to be prepared for prolonged transports. For patients          
< 10kg, transfer the diluted Push-dose Epinephrine to a smaller (1mL or 3mL) syringe in order to 
administer the dose accurately. 
 
⓰  Consider SGA placement if needed to facilitate effective ventilations during transport. In patients 
longer than the length-based resuscitation tape (e.g., Broselow tape) or > 40 kg body weight for 
whom intubation is also in scope of practice, SGAs are the preferred advanced airway unless 
specifically contraindicated.  Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, 
circumstances, and skill level when selecting the advanced airway modality for pediatric patients in 
whom multiple modalities are authorized.

⓱  Narcotic overdose should be suspected in cases where there is drug paraphernalia on scene or there 
is a witness report. Pinpoint pupils may be present, but hypoxia during cardiac arrest more often 
causes mydriasis (dilated pupils) instead. 
 
⓲ EMS is assisting the Department of Public Health (DPH) in promptly investigating fatal or nonfatal 
drownings at public pools or spas in order to ensure safety can be verified before reopening. 
Contacting the on-call DPH officer will allow timely investigation of these incidents and prevent future 
incidents.
