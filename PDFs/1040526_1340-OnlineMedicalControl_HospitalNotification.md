Medical Control Guideline:  ONLINE MEDICAL DIRECTION AND 
RECEIVING HOSPITAL NOTIFICATION 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
 1.   Online Medical Direction is    provided to prehospital provider(s) via voice communication 
from qualified Base hospital personnel (MICN or Base Physician) for the purposes of 
real-time patient care. 
 
 2.   Receiving hospital notification is communication of patient information by prehospital 
provider(s) or Base hospital personnel for the purpose of preparing the receiving hospital 
staff for patient arrival. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
1.   Online medical direction occurs when Base hospital contact is established by 
paramedics in order to obtain guidance on patient care from a designated paramedic 
Base hospital. 
2.   In general, for situations requiring base hospital contact, the time when Base hospital 
contact is established will be based on paramedic judgement unless otherwise specified.  
3.   The paramedic who provides direct patient care during transport shall have a means to 
establish communication with the Base hospital at all times. 
4.   Once Base hospital contact is made for medical direction, the overall authority for 
patient’s medical care lies with the Base. The treatment plan based on Provider 
Impression should be developed collaboratively by prehospital providers and Base 
personnel. 
5.   Treatments outlined in the applicable protocol may be administered by prehospital 
providers and communicated to the Base hospital. 
6.   Communication shall be maintained until the Base hospital ends the call. 
7.   If Base hospital contact is made, the Base hospital is responsible for notifying the 
receiving hospital. 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1.   Paramedics shall establish Base hospital contact for online medical direction on all 
patients who meet Base hospital contact criteria as specified in Ref. 1200.1, Treatment 
Protocol General Instructions and when directed by the Treatment Protocols. 
 
2.   Utilize radios, the VMED28 radio frequency, or telephone to establish Base hospital 
contact. 
 
3.   Paramedics shall clearly indicate the reason for the contact: 
 
a.   “Base Contact for online medical direction” or may simply state “Base Contact”
