Medical Control Guideline:  NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION BY EMS PROVIDERS 
(LEAVE BEHIND NALOXONE) 
 
PURPOSE:  To authorize and describe procedures for EMS personnel to distribute naloxone 
kits to individuals at risk for experiencing or witnessing an opioid overdose. 
 
PRINCIPLES:                                                                                                                                                                        
 
1.   Opioid overdose is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.  
 
2.   Naloxone is a life-saving medication that reverses an opioid overdose by blocking the 
opioid receptor, reversing the toxic effects of the overdose, with minimal to no effect on 
an individual if opioids are not present in their system.  
 
3.   Providing overdose prevention, recognition, and response education to drug users and 
their neighbors, friends, and families is a harm reduction intervention that saves lives.  
 
4. The Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP) is a federally funded “Leave Behind 
Naloxone” initiative administered by the Department of Health Care Services 
(DHCS) in California to combat opioid overdose-related deaths through the free 
distribution of naloxone to qualifying entities for the purpose of distribution to persons 
at risk for opiod overdose and those in a position to assist those persons at risk. 
EMS agencies in California are qualified entities to participate in this program.
 
 
5.   EMS personnel are encouraged to distribute naloxone to individuals at risk for opioid 
overdose, or any person in a position to assist individuals at risk, and train these 
individuals on appropriate naloxone use. 
 
GUIDELINES:  
 
1.   EMS provider agencies may obtain naloxone kits, intended for layperson use, for 
distribution by EMS personnel to opioid overdose at risk individuals through the following 
mechanisms: 
 
a.   NDP by completing and submitting an application to the DHCS to participate in 
the NDP program (free of charge). 
https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/individuals/Documents/NDP-Application.pdf 
b.   EMS provider’s normal supply chain 
 
2.   Naloxone shall not be distributed to patients or bystanders from the responding EMS 
unit’s (i.e., ALS/Assessment Unit) inventory supply. 
 
3.   EMS personnel may distribute naloxone, after performing a patient assessment, to 
individuals who are at risk for opioid overdose or to persons in a position to assist the 
individual at risk if the at-risk individual meets any ONE of the following criteria: 
  
a.   The individual was treated by EMS for an opioid overdose with naloxone or 
supportive care 
b.   The individual’s history or physical exam demonstrates evidence of illicit opioid 
use (history of intravenous drug use, track marks, needles present, etc.)

c.   The individual’s history or physical exam demonstrates prescription opioid use 
(prescribed or recreational) 
d.   The physical environment has opioids or drug paraphernalia present 
 
4.   Distribution of naloxone to opioid at risk individuals must occur in accordance with the 
following procedures: 
 
a.   Distribution   Process   
 
i.    Assess and confirm the individual receiving the naloxone has decision 
making capacity 
ii.   Offer leave behind naloxone to the patient, and/or family 
iii.  If the individual agrees to receive naloxone, perform just-in-time training on 
correct use to the patient and family/supporting persons, if present 
iv.  Document naloxone distribution in the ePCR (distributed “leave behind 
naloxone should be described in narrative and accounted for as a 
medication administered in the ePCR, distinct from therapeutically 
administered naloxone). 
 
b.   Training   
 
i.    Perform training for the individual receiving naloxone including: 
 
-     Recognizing signs and symptoms of overdose 
-     Calling     911     
-     Naloxone     administration     
-     Rescue     breathing     
-     Post-overdose     care     
 
ii.   Recommend that the trained individual can complete further training online 
at https://www.getnaloxonenow.org/#home 
 
c.   Disposition   
 
i.    All patients treated for opioid overdose should be managed in accordance 
with TP 1241 or 1241-P, Overdose / Poisoning / Ingestion  
ii.   Patients who decline transport against medical advice should still be 
offered “Leave Behind Naloxone” 
 
d.   End of Shift 
 
i.    Re-stock naloxone kits 
ii.   Submit naloxone distribution log per provider agency procedures and in 
accordance with NDP requirements if participating in the NDP program.
