PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Hospital EMS Surge Assistance Plan will be implemented as a coordinated 
system directed by the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services (EMS)

2. The purpose of the ARS is to enable ALS and BLS emergency transport 
ambulances to return to service as soon as possible.

3. The ARS does not remove EMTALA responsibility; it is intended to minimize the 
effects of the patient surge on the EMS system. 
 
4. While EMS personnel may assist with monitoring patients in the ARS, patient 
care in the ARS is the responsibility of the hospital. 
 
5. The ED attending physician and charge nurse must initiate a plan for appropriate 
triage and care of all patients in the ARS. 
 
6. The hospital AOD shall be notified by the ED attending or ED charge nurse when 
the Hospital EMS Surge Assistance Plan is implemented. 
 
7. The AREP coordinates all EMS resources in the ARS and determines when EMS 
personnel are no longer needed for monitoring. 
 
8. Each EMT and Paramedic may observe up to 4 patients in the ARS. EMTs and 
Paramedics will provide care, as per their scope of practice. 
 
9. The ARS EMT or Paramedic observing patients in the ARS shall immediately 
notify the Hospital EMS Triage Officer if any patient shows signs of deterioration. 
I. CRITERIA FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF HOSPITAL EMS SURGE ASSISTANCE PLAN: 
 
A. All available patient treatment areas, including hallways, within the ED are fully 
occupied and ambulance patients are being managed outside of the ED, and; 
 
B. Three (3) or more ambulances are waiting to offload patients for greater than one 
(1) hour or; 
 
C. Three (3) or more Immediate patients are being managed by EMS personnel in 
ambulances waiting to be triaged by emergency department (ED) personnel. 
II. PROCEDURE FOR IMPLEMENTATION: 
 
A. Hospital ED personnel or EMS Provider Agency personnel will contact the Los 
Angeles County EMS Agency’s Medical Alert Center (MAC) when the Criteria for 
Implementation are met (Section I). 
 
B. MAC will contact the EMS Agency AOD and MOD who will assess and determine 
the need for implementation as well as the need to divert ALS and/or BLS 
patients to other facilities. Upon approval from the AOD/MOD, the MAC shall 
notify the Coordinating Dispatch Center that the Hospital EMS Surge Assistance 
Plan should be implemented. 
 
C. The MAC will coordinate communication between EMS Agency AOD/MOD and 
the EMS Provider AREP to discuss deployment to the hospital.

D. The AREP will respond to the hospital. 
 
E. The AREP will communicate with the ED Attending physician on duty, the ED 
charge nurse and/or the hospital AOD. 
 
F. If prolonged ambulance patient offload time (e.g., > 2 hours) is anticipated, the 
EMS Provider AREP will notify their Dispatch Center for EMS Patient Surge 
assistance. 
 
G. The AREP will coordinate with EMS ambulance crews on scene to allow for 
monitoring of multiple patients based on available resources; the following 
strategies may be employed: 
 
1. One EMS crew on scene will be designated to remain in the ARS to 
observe patients and communicate with the Hospital EMS Triage Officer. 
Departing EMS crews will provide information on patient status to 
remaining EMS providers in the ARS and the Hospital EMS Triage 
Officer.  
 
2. If additional EMS resources are needed, the AREP will notify their 
respective Dispatch Centers and request for additional resources (e.g., 
Battalion Chief, engine, truck, and ambulances) 
 
3. The EMS Provider AREP will coordinate with the MAC and the EMS 
Agency MOD to assist in ambulance triage, and to screen ambulance 
traffic for possible diversion to less impacted hospitals. 
 
H. The hospital shall designate and deploy a Hospital EMS Triage Officer who will 
coordinate with the AREP for the offload and monitoring of patients by EMS 
personnel.  
 
1. The role of the Hospital EMS Triage Officer is to ensure that patients are 
entered into the hospital’s electronic medical record (eMR), assist EMS 
personnel in directing units, and communicating directly with the ED 
charge nurse for patients that require an immediate life or limb saving 
intervention. 
 
2. Unless otherwise designated, the Hospital EMS Triage Officer shall not 
be assigned direct patient care responsibilities within the ED and there 
shall be no ratio of patients for this position. 
 
I. Hospital shall identify an ambulance receiving space (ARS).   
 
1. These spaces need to be supplied with chairs, stretchers or cots, 
blankets, oxygen tanks, and medical supplies/equipment as available.

2. Ideally the ARS should be a tent with climate control and separate spaces 
for suspected infectious patients, and those that have other complaints. If 
a tent is not available, EZ-Ups may be used. If no shelter is available, 
then tarps may be deployed. 
 
3. These items should be procured from local vendors or from the hospital 
disaster caches. If unable to procure, submit a resource request to the 
EMS Agency as some items may be obtained from the Disaster Resource 
Center cache, or the EMS Agency Disaster cache. 
 
4. The hospital will provide a means to communicate with the Hospital EMS 
Triage Officer and the AREP and EMS crew in the ARS (e.g., 
walkie/talkie or cell phone). 
 
J. Patients arriving via ambulance shall be categorized as: 
a. Expectant – Patients arriving at the hospital shall be immediately 
assessed for prognosis and futility of effort. If futility is determined, 
resuscitation shall be terminated. Expectant patients shall be 
received by the hospital and captured in the hospital eMR. The 
decedent shall not be transferred to an ED treatment station but 
rather transported to the hospital morgue in order to release the 
ambulance crew back into service. 
 
b. Immediate (red) – These are patients who exhibit severe 
respiratory, circulatory or neurological symptoms that would likely 
result in significant morbidity or mortality if not addressed within 1 
hour. These patients require rapid assessment and medical 
intervention. The hospital EMS Triage Officer shall notify the 
Charge Nurse upon the arrival of an immediate patient. Patients in 
this category shall be given priority to offload to an ED treatment 
station when available. In the absence of an available ED 
treatment station, these patients shall be offloaded in the ARS or 
assigned an ambulance parking space closest to the hospital EMS 
Triage Officer. In this situation, the ambulance back doors should 
remain open so patients may be directly observed. Immediate 
patients shall further be categorized to ensure that the most 
gravely ill is assigned a place closest to the ED ambulance 
entrance for transport into the ED as soon as directed by the 
hospital EMS Triage Officer or the AREP may notify the MAC and 
the EMS Agency MOD for possible rerouting. 
 
c. Delayed (yellow) – These are patients who have a potentially 
serious medical or surgical condition but who are stable to wait 
until resources are not encumbered. These patients will typically 
require a gurney upon arrival at the hospital. Delayed patients 
shall be offloaded to stretcher or cots in the ARS. The Hospital 
EMS Triage Office shall ensure that delayed patients are captured

in the hospital’s eMR. Hospital personnel or EMS Providers shall 
be assigned to monitor these patients. EMTs and/or paramedics 
may be assigned to observe up to 4 patients. 
 
d. Minor (green) – These are patients who are alert and oriented, 
able to sit in a chair, and medically stable. These patients shall be 
taken to the ED waiting room as per Ref. No. 505, Ambulance 
Patient Offload Time, Policy II. C. The Hospital EMS Triage Officer 
shall ensure these patients are captured in the hospital’s eMR.
