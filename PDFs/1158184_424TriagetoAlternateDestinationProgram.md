2. The EMS Agency has oversight authority to conduct onsite visits, inspect, investigate, 
and discipline a Designated TAD Facility, TAD paramedic, TAD paramedic provider 
agency, TAD paramedic training program, and TAD programs for any violations to the 
standards set forth herein through denial, probation, suspension, or revocation of the 
approval and/or accreditation. 
 
3. No person or organizations shall offer a TAD paramedic training program or TAD 
programs without the authorization from the EMS Agency. 
 
4. The EMS Agency may exclude existing paramedic provider agencies from participating 
in the TAD program. Reasons may include: no designated TAD facilities can be 
accessed within patient destination transport guidelines, EMS resources are 
unreasonably removed from the paramedic provider agency’s primary area of response, 
and participation will negatively impact patient care. The EMS Agency will provide the 
paramedic provider agency a written response outlining the reasons for exclusion.  
 
5. A TAD paramedic’s decision to transport to a designated TAD facility shall not be based 
on, or affected by, a patient’s ethnicity, citizenship, age, preexisting medical condition, 
insurance status, economic status, ability to pay for medical services, or any other 
characteristics listed in Section 51 of the Civil Code except in circumstances in which 
age, sex, preexisting medical condition, or physical or mental disability is medically 
significant to the provision of appropriate medical care to the patient. A violation of 
Section 51 of the Civil Code will result in immediate termination from the program.  
 
6. Maintaining skills competency and effective quality improvement program are important 
components for implementing and sustaining a successful TAD program. TAD provider 
agencies must ensure active clinical practice and participation in the quality 
improvement program for their TAD paramedics.
