 California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 5 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Behavioral/Psychiatric Crisis: A provider impression for patients who are having a mental 
health crisis or a mental health emergency. This is not for anxiety or agitation secondary to 
medical etiology. 
 
Emergency Medical Condition: A condition or situation in which an individual has an 
immediate need for medical attention. The presence of abnormal vital signs (heart rate and 
rhythm, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation – except isolated asymptomatic 
hypertension) are also indications of an emergency medical condition. Patients who meet any 
criteria for Base Contact or Receiving Hospital Notification (Ref. No. 1200.2) are also 
considered to have an emergency medical condition. 
 
Mental Health Crisis: Is a non-life-threatening situation in which an individual is exhibiting 
extreme emotional disturbance or behavioral distress, considering harm to self or others, 
disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a compromised ability to function, or is otherwise 
agitated and unable to be calmed. Examples of mental health crisis includes: 
 
• Talking about suicide threats 
• Talking about threatening behavior 
• Self-injury, but not needing immediate medical attention 
• Alcohol or substance abuse 
• Highly erratic or unusual behavior 
• Eating disorders 
• Not taking their prescribed psychiatric medications 
• Emotionally distraught, very depressed, angry or anxious 
 
Mental Health Emergency: Is a life-threatening situation in which an individual is imminently 
threatening harm to self or others, severely disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a severe 
inability to function, or is otherwise distraught and out of control. Examples of a mental health 
emergency includes: 
 
• Acting on a suicide threat 
• Homicidal or threatening behavior

• Self-injury needing immediate medical attention 
• Severely impaired by drugs or alcohol 
• Highly erratic or unusual behavior that indicates very unpredictable behavior 
and/or inability to care for themselves 
 
Most Accessible Receiving Facility (MAR): Is the geographically closest (by distance) 9-1-1 
Receiving Hospital approved by the EMS Agency to receive patients with emergency medical 
conditions from the 9-1-1 system. 
 
Psychiatric Urgent Care Center (PUCC): A mental health facility authorized by the 
Department of Mental Health and approved by the EMS Agency by meeting the requirements in 
Ref. No. 326, Psychiatric Urgent Care Center Standards. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. EMS provider agencies must be approved by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
Agency to triage patients with behavioral/psychiatric crisis to a designated PUCC. 
 
2. Patients experiencing a behavioral/psychiatric crisis who have altered level of 
consciousness (ALOC) must be transported to an emergency department for evaluation. 
 
3. Paramedics who have completed an 8-hour educational session regarding the triage of 
patients to a PUCC are the only EMS personnel authorized to utilize this policy. 
 
4. Patients exhibiting mental health crisis who meet PUCC inclusion criteria may also be 
released at the scene to the local law enforcement agency. Law enforcement officers are 
highly encouraged to transport these patients to a designated PUCC. Paramedics shall 
document on the EMS Report Form to whom the patient was released. 
 
5. Patients receiving olanzapine who are cooperative and meet the criteria for screening as 
per Ref. 526.1 Medical Clearance Criteria Screening Tool for Psychiatric Urgent Care 
Center (PUCC), may be transported by EMS (basic life support) or released to law 
enforcement to the PUCC. 
 
6. In instances where there is a potential for the patient to harm self or others, EMS 
personnel shall consider seeking assistance from law enforcement. 
 
7. Any patient who meets the triage criteria for transport to a PUCC, but who requests to be 
transported to an emergency department of a general acute care hospital, shall be 
transported to the emergency department of a general acute care hospital.  
 
8. In all cases, the health and well-being of the patient is the overriding consideration in 
determining patient destination. Factors to be considered include severity and stability of 
the patient’s illness or injury; status of the receiving facility; anticipated transport time; 
requests by the patient, family, guardian or physician; and EMS personnel and base 
hospital judgment.
