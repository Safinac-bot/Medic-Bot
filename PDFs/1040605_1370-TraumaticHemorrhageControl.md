COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES REFERENCE NO. 1370 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE: 07-01-14 PAGE 1 OF 2

SUPERSEDES: 12-01-23 
Medical Control Guideline: TRAUMATIC HEMORRHAGE CONTROL 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Applying direct continuous pressure to the area of bleeding should be the first 
management technique to control external bleeding. 
 
2. Tourniquets have been demonstrated to be safe and effective when used appropriately 
and can be lifesaving. 
 
3. A hemorrhage control tourniquet should be used if external bleeding from an extremity 
cannot be controlled by direct pressure to an exposed wound. 
 
4. Poorly perfusing patients with an isolated penetrating extremity injury and those with 
amputations or mangled extremities should have a tourniquet applied even if minimal to 
no visible bleeding. 
 
5. Tourniquet application may be the initial method to control extremity bleeding when 
scene safety concerns, resource limitations, or patient positioning/entrapment preclude 
direct pressure application. 
 
6. Tourniquet application frequently results in severe pain. Pain management should be 
provided as necessary.  
 
7. Hemostatic Agents are only to be utilized by approved providers.  
 
8. Tranexamic acid (TXA) acts to prevent clot breakdown and improves outcomes for 
trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock if administered within 3 hours of injury, with 
increasing benefit the sooner it is administered. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. First, remove any bandages applied by patient or bystanders (this may include 
tourniquets if they are inappropriately applied, ineffective or obstructing care), identify 
the area of bleeding, and apply continuous, firm, focused pressure directly to source of 
bleeding using gauze or hemostatic agents as appropriate. 
 
2. If unable to control hemorrhage with direct pressure, or if scene or patient safety 
precludes application of direct pressure, prepare for tourniquet application. 
 
3. Explain usage of tourniquet to the patient if patient’s condition allows. 
 
4. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application of the tourniquet. 
 
5. Apply tourniquet 2-3 inches proximal to the bleeding site but not over a joint or the 
hemorrhaging injury. 
 
6. Ensure that bleeding is stopped and distal pulses are absent after the application of the 
tourniquet. 
 
7. Once a tourniquet is applied, the patient should be reassessed at least every 5 minutes

for continued absence of distal pulse and/or bleeding. 
 
8. If bleeding is not controlled with one tourniquet, a second tourniquet may be applied 
proximal to the first tourniquet. Do not remove the first tourniquet after applying the 
second tourniquet. 
 
9. Once a tourniquet is properly applied by EMS it should not be loosened or removed 
without physician approval.  
 
10. Provide analgesia when tourniquets are placed per MCG 1345 and refer to TP 1244 or 
1244-P, Traumatic Injury and TP 1242 or 1242-P, Crush Injury/Syndrome as appropriate 
for dosing. 
 
11. For adult patients within 3 hours of injury and uncontrolled external/extremity bleeding 
despite applying pressure, and use of hemostatic agents and tourniquets where 
appropriate, administer TXA per MCG 1317.41.  
 
12. For adult patients within 3 hours of injury with suspected uncompressible truncal 
hemorrhage and systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90mmHg OR heart rate>SBP, 
administer TXA per MCG 1317.41.   
 
13. Paramedics shall make Base hospital contact and transport in accordance with           
Ref. 1200.1 and Ref. 502, Patient Destination. In general, patients requiring tourniquets 
and/or TXA should be transported to a Trauma Center. 
 
14. Paramedic shall document the time tourniquet applied on the tourniquet and on the EMS 
electronic Patient Care Record (ePCR). Remaining patient documentation will be in 
accordance with Ref. 606, Documentation of Prehospital Care.
