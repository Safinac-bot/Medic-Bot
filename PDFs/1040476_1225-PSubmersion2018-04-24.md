SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Cardiac arrest from drowning should be treated per TP 1210-P, Cardiac Arrest. Ventilation is 
particularly important as the cardiac arrest is almost always due to respiratory failure. In cases of cold 
water drowning follow usual protocols for resuscitation while simultaneously rewarming the patient. 
Patients with hypothermia due to cold water drowning, may have good neurologic outcome despite 
prolonged resuscitation; resuscitative efforts should continue until the patient is rewarmed.  
Consultation with the Base Physician is required before consideration of termination of resuscitation 
in patients with suspected hypothermia. 
 
❷  Decompression illness includes arterial gas embolism from barotrauma and decompression   
sickness (aka “the bends”) due to dissolved nitrogen in the blood coming out of solution.  
Decompression illness most frequently occurs in scuba divers after breathing compressed air at 
depth. While arterial gas embolism presents almost immediately after ascent, decompression 
sickness is often delayed and should be considered in any patient with symptoms (e.g. respiratory 
distress, ALOC, chest or body pain) within 24 hours of completing a dive. All patients with possible 
decompression illness need immediate evaluation for possible hyperbaric treatment. Per Ref. 518, 
contact Base immediately to discuss. 
 
❸    Warming measures should include moving the patient to a warm environment as quickly as possible, 
removing wet clothing/items, covering with an emergency/rescue blanket or other blankets/sheets, 
and using warm Normal Saline if available.  
 
❹ Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body 
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat. 
 
❺  Rales may be present in patients after submersion/drowning due to direct lung injury and/or 
aspiration of water. This is not an indication of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (such as from 
congestive heart failure), which is extremely rare in children, and does not prohibit administration of 
IV fluids. IV fluids should be initiated and continued unless respiratory status worsens during 
administration.  
 
❻ EMS is assisting the Department of Public Health (DPH) in promptly investigating fatal or nonfatal 
drownings at public pools or spas in order to ensure safety can be verified before reopening. 
Contacting the on-call DPH officer will allow timely investigation of these incidents and prevent future 
incidents.
