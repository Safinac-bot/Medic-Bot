11. Initiate CPAP for alert patients with moderate or severe respiratory distress with length greater 
than the length-based resuscitation tape (e.g., Broselow Tape) 
Hold CPAP for patients with hypotension, suspected pneumothorax, upper airway 
edema/obstruction, or other contraindications (MCG 1315) ❿ 
 
12. For poor perfusion (MCG 1355): 
Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV rapid infusion per MCG 1309

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶   Consider wearing surgical mask when caring for patients with respiratory distress of unclear etiology, 
which may be infectious. 
  
❷ Patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease may be expected to have a measured SpO2 of 75-
85%. Parents/caretakers may also know the patient’s “normal” SpO2 range. It is important to ask 
caretakers and consider this possibility, as administration of Oxygen in these patients will worsen 
respiratory status. 
 
❸ Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with a viral filter is the preferred method of airway management for 
pediatric patients. Initiate BMV to assess patient response. Effective BMV may improve the patient’s 
respiratory status enough to restore adequate spontaneous respirations.  Place advanced airway 
placement if BMV is ineffective or consider placement once assessment for rapidly reversible causes 
is complete as authorized per MCG 1302; supraglottic airway (sizing per MCG 1309) is preferred 
unless contraindicated. Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, 
circumstances, and skill level when selecting the advanced airway modality for pediatric patients in 
whom multiple modalities are authorized. 
 
❹    If positive pressure ventilation is performed at any time, document Provider Impression as 
Respiratory Arrest / Respiratory Failure. 
 
❺ Fowler’s or Semi-Fowler’s positioning is likely to be most comfortable for awake patients with 
respiratory distress. Avoid agitating children with suspected partial foreign body obstruction and/or 
impending airway failure. Allow parents/caretakers to handle/facilitate patient if safe to do so. 
 
❻ In pediatric patients with respiratory distress, bradycardia is likely to represent a pre-terminal event, 
ensure that oxygenation and ventilation is adequate; bradycardic dysrhythmia is persistent despite 
adequate oxygenation and ventilation before moving to TP 1212-P, Cardiac Dysrhythmia – 
Bradycardia. Respiratory rates vary by age and normal ranges can be found in MCG 1309.   
 
❼ Consider blow-by to avoid agitation in pediatric patients if a mask cannot be tolerated (e.g., infants 
and toddlers).  
 
❽ Administration of albuterol via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer is considered equivalent to 
nebulized albuterol; a spacer is typically required for this route to be effective in novice users. MDIs 
are single use and should be left with the hospital staff upon handoff of the patient. 
 
❾ Epinephrine may be administered prior to albuterol as initial drug therapy in patients with Respiratory 
Failure due to bronchospasm. 
 
❿    While CPAP may be used in pediatric patients, current ALS equipment does not support use of 
CPAP in pediatric patients who are not longer than the length-based resuscitation tape (e.g., 
Broselow Tape).  
 
⓫ Etiologies of respiratory distress in pediatrics are varied; etiologies may include the following: 
• Bronchospasm due to asthma, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease or viral illness – 
document Provider Impression as Respiratory Distress / Bronchospasm
