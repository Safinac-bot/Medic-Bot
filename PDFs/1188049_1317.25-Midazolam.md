≥12 years (Longer than the length-based tape if age unknown) 
10 mg or 2mL IM/IN repeat x1 in 2 min prn, 
  Single dose prior to Base contact 
   
For patients with severe growth restriction (e.g., genetic disorder, severe malnutrition), 
administer weight-based dose per color code. 
 
May repeat Midazolam as above, maximum total of 3 doses or 20 milligrams, whichever is less 
 
Mechanism of Action 
Binds to receptors at several sites within the CNS, potentiates GABA receptor system which produces 
anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic effects.  
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset 3-5 min IV, 15-20 min IM, 6-14 min IN 
Duration 1-6 hours IV/IM 
 
Contraindications 
Respiratory depression 
Shock / Poor perfusion (see prehospital considerations) 
 
Interactions 
Risk of respiratory or central nervous system depression, increases when used with diphenhydramine, 
fentanyl, morphine, or other opiate or sedative medications 
 
Adverse Effects 
Hypotension 
Respiratory depression / arrest 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Closely monitor respiratory and cardiac function after administration 
• Caution in patients with suspected intoxication as midazolam can increase the risk for respiratory 
depression 
• For patients with severe agitation and violent behavior, IM/IN administration is recommended over IV 
for the initial dose for the safety of EMS personnel. 
• If available, waveform EtCO
2
 monitoring should be instituted after administration. 
• For patients who are poorly perfusing and require sedation for safety (e.g., prevent inadvertent 
extubation) or require a painful procedure (e.g., transcutaneous pacing), one should use judgment in 
consultation with Base.
