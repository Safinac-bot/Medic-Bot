SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 ❶   The more frequent the contractions, the closer the patient is to delivery; if the contractions are            
< 2 minutes apart or last > 60 seconds prepare for delivery.  
Women who have had prior vaginal 
deliveries can progress through labor very rapidly.
 
 
 ❷    Crowning, urge to push, or presentation of a presenting part indicate imminent delivery.
