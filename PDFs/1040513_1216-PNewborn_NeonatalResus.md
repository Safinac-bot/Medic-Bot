Base Hospital Contact required for all newborn deliveries  
 
1. Assist delivery; if amniotic sac intact and crown is presenting part, pinch sac and twist 
membrane to rupture and continue with delivery. Treat mother per TP 1215-P, Childbirth 
(mother)  
 
2. Dry, warm and stimulate newborn by drying with towel ❶ 
 
3. Assess airway and initiate basic airway management (MCG 1302; 1309)  
Monitor Pulse oximetry on right hand of newborn ❷ 
For airway obstruction suction prn; mouth first then nostrils ❸ 
 
4. Clamp and cut cord ❹ 
 
5. If newborn is vigorous, after drying and warming with a towel place on mother’s chest skin-to-
skin to ensure heat transfer to the newborn; cover mother and newborn with a blanket  
 
6. Transport newborn and mother to same facility (EDAP and Perinatal Center) 
 
7. Reassess every 30 sec the need for assisted ventilation or CPR intervention  
 
8. Check pulse at the precordium (auscultation), the base of the umbilical cord or at the brachial 
artery 
 
9. If further resuscitation required, initiate resuscitation on scene prior to transport 
 
IF PULSE < 100bpm OR poor respiratory rate, effort, or persistent central cyanosis ❺ 
 
10. Perform BMV with room air for 90 secs, squeeze the bag just enough to see chest rise then 
release; state “squeeze, release” to avoid hyperventilation 
 
11. Recheck pulse every 30 secs  
For persistent poor respiratory rate, effort or central cyanosis, add high flow Oxygen 15L/min 
to BMV 
Assess the need for chest compressions  
 
12. Establish vascular access (MCG 1375) 
If unable to obtain peripheral vascular access, place IO; should not take precedence over 
emergency transport ❻ 
 
IF PULSE < 60bpm ❼ 
 
13. Begin BMV with high flow oxygen and chest compressions at a rate of 120/min, maintain 3:1 
compression to ventilation ratio (90 compressions to 30 ventilations per minute); continue for 2 
minutes before pulse check. 
• Consider supraglottic airway in infants 3 kg or greater, if BMV ineffective or cardiac arrest 
despite BMV, size per MCG 1309

14. Epinephrine (0.1mg/1mL) 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO push dose per MCG 1309  
May repeat every 5 min  
 
15. Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV/IO rapid infusion per MCG 1309 
CONTACT BASE for persistent poor perfusion (MCG 1355) to obtain order for additional 
Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV/IO per MCG 1309 
 
16. Once pulse is > 60bpm, chest compressions should be discontinued  
 
17. Transport newborn and mother to the same facility which is an EDAP or PMC and Perinatal 
Center with a NICU ❽

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶   This protocol is be used for the newly born only; infants otherwise within the first month of life use TP 
1210-P Pediatric Cardiac Arrest. The most important intervention for a resuscitation of the newly born 
in the field is to “Dry, Warm and Stimulate” – this allows for reversal of apnea after delivery. 
  
❷   “Dry, Warm, and Stimulate then you have to Ventilate” – If respiratory effort poor or HR <100bpm 
then Ventilate using BMV. The most important signs to monitor are respiratory effort, pulse oximetry 
and heart rate. Measuring the pulse oximetry on the right hand provides the most accurate oxygen 
saturation in infants that are transitioning from fetal to normal circulation. At 60 seconds, 60% is the 
target with an increase of 5% every minute until 5 minutes of life when pulse oximetry is 80-85%. 
   
Time Since Birth 
Projected Increase in 
Pulse Oximeter Over Time 
1 minute 60-65% 
2 minutes 65-70% 
3 minutes 70-75% 
4 minutes 75-80% 
5 minutes 80-85% 
10 minutes 85-90% 
 
Assessments that are used to initiate BMV and chest compressions. 
 
Heart Rate (bpm)

Distress/Apnea

Present 
Intervention 
> 100 No Yes Blow-by Oxygen 
--- Yes Yes/No BMV 
60-100 - - BMV 
<60 - - BMV; Chest 
compressions 
 
❸    Suction prior to delivery is no longer recommended for presence of meconium (thick or thin). 
Suctioning should occur only if there is airway obstruction present and mouth should be suctioned 
first followed by the nose. 
 
❹    Delay in clamping and cutting the cord for up 30 to 60 seconds is recommended unless the newborn  
     needs immediate resuscitation. 
 
❺    Assessing pulse at the base of the umbilical cord is preferred, pulse rate < 100bpm is a sign of 
newborn distress and requires BMV. 
 
❻ In obtaining vascular access, place an IO in a newborn use light pressure as the bone cortices are 
soft and the needle can easily penetrate both cortices of the bone.  
 
❼   Chest compression should be initiated in newborns with a pulse < 60bpm and continued until the 
pulse increases > 60bpm.

❽   Newborns requiring field resuscitation are at high risk for complications and will require critical care 
by neonatologists; consider stability of both patients for destination decisions (Mother and Newborn).
