Medical Control Guideline:  SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION 
 
DEFINITION:  Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR) describes the procedure used to care for 
patients with possible unstable spinal injuries.  SMR includes: Reduction of gross movement by 
the patient; prevention of additional damage to the spine; and regular reassessment of 
motor/sensory function. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1.   SMR involves maintaining a neutral in-line position of the spine at all times during patient 
treatment and transport.  SMR requires the patient’s head, neck and torso to be 
appropriately stabilized.  This can be achieved manually or with the use of commercially 
available equipment. 
 
2.   There are multiple commercial devices that may be used to assist with SMR during 
patient movement.  In addition, there are harmful side effects of these devices that must 
be considered. 
 
3.   Prehospital provider assessment will determine if SMR should be initiated.  
 
4.   Prehospital providers   should use judgment and consider SMR for patients without 
neurologic findings, but in whom one is still concerned for unstable spinal injury.  
  
5.   A cervical collar alone does not provide adequate SMR.  To provide appropriate SMR, 
the patient must be maintained in a neutral in-line position during movement and while 
on the gurney. Patients with potential thoracolumbar injury should be supine or reverse 
Trendelenburg. 
 
6.   The backboard is an extrication device.  It may also be used to provide splinting during 
movement of patients with multiple traumatic injuries.  While a backboard may be used 
to assist with SMR during the extrication phase, it is not required for SMR.  
 
7.   Once the patient is on the ambulance gurney, the backboard does not provide any 
advantage and may cause harm related to increased pain, increased lateral movement, 
and increased imaging at the hospital. 
 
8.   The backboard should not be maintained during transport for the purposes of SMR. 
Whenever possible, patients should be rolled off the backboard prior to transport.  
Exceptions include patients who are hemodynamically unstable or when there are scene 
safety concerns. 
 
9.   A backboard should not be used in the ambulatory patient (i.e., a patient who is standing 
and/or walking at the time of EMS arrival).   
 
10.  SMR is generally not indicated for penetrating injuries and transport must not be delayed 
to maintain SMR.  Treatment of patients with penetrating trauma should not involve a 
backboard unless it is required as an extrication device.   
 
11.  Safe and proper removal of the helmet should be done by two people following steps 
outlined in an approved trauma curriculum.

12.  Paramedic assessment, in accordance with guidelines below, will determine whether 
SMR is required. Whenever BLS has initiated SMR, paramedics should strongly 
consider maintaining c-collar and spinal precautions until hospital evaluation. Once SMR 
has been determined necessary based upon paramedic assessment, it should be 
maintained throughout the prehospital phase of care by whatever methods the provider 
deems appropriate. This does not include continuation of the backboard, which, if used 
to assist during extrication, should be removed once patient is on gurney. 
 
13.  The method by which SMR is maintained and devices used may be adjusted to meet the 
needs of the patient.  In particular, management of the patient’s airway may necessitate 
alternate SMR methods and should take precedence. 
 
14.  For purposes of the assessment, an unreliable patient is anyone who is altered, 
intoxicated or nonverbal.  Limited evaluation may be due to communication barrier, 
uncooperative patient or patient too distracted by other injuries and circumstances.  An 
abnormal spine exam is any deformity or tenderness along the spine. 
 
15.  For the purposes of the pediatric assessment, an abnormal torso exam refers to 
evidence of substantial torso injury, defined as injuries thought to be potentially life 
threatening to the thorax including the chest wall, abdomen, flanks, back and pelvis with 
an unstable chest wall, abdominal distension or significant  chest or abdominal 
tenderness. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1.   Every patient with trauma, including ambulatory patients, must receive an assessment.  
If any assessment component is positive, the patient requires SMR.                           
(See age-appropriate SMR algorithm.) 
 
2.   Patients initially placed in SMR by BLS providers whose care is transferred to ALS 
providers, shall receive a paramedic assessment to determine if continuation of SMR is 
indicated. 
 
3.   Neurological examination includes:  
a.   Test of sensation and abnormal sensation (parasthesias) in all 4 extremities   
b.   Test of motor skills in all 4 extremities with active movements by the patient        
(avoid just reflexive movements like hand grasp) to include:  wrist/finger extension 
and flexion, foot plantar and dorsiflexion   
c.   Frequent reassessment. 
 
4.   All history and examinations pertinent to the decision for SMR, as outlined in the adult 
and pediatric algorithms, must be assessed and documented on the EMS Report Form 
or ePCR. 
 
5.   Padding may be necessary to maintain neutral alignment particularly in children <3 years 
old who have a large occiput forcing the head forward when supine. 
 
6.   Infants in rear facing car seats may be immobilized and extricated in the car seat as long 
as the patient is stable and does not exhibit signs of respiratory distress or shock. 
 
7.   Children restrained in a car seat with a high back should be extricated in the car seat 
and then be placed in SMR as appropriate.  Children in booster seats (without a back) 
should be placed in SMR as appropriate.
