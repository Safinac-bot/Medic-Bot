In California, paramedic training programs are approved by the local EMS agency in the County in which the training program is 
located.  Additionally, paramedic training programs in California are required to be accredited by the Committee on Accreditation of 
Educational Programs for Emergency Medical Services Professions (CoAEMSP). 
 
Currently, there are three Los Angeles County approved paramedic training programs.  Contact the program directly for entrance 
requirements, class dates and information.  For a list of approved Paramedic Training Programs in California
