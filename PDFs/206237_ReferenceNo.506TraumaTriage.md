APPROVED: ________________________ ______________________________ 
Director, EMS Agency   Medical Director, EMS Agency 
PURPOSE: To establish criteria and standards which ensure that patients requiring the care 
of a trauma center are appropriately triaged and transported. 
 
AUTHORITY: California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Section 1105(c) California Code of 
Regulations, Title 22, Section 100236 et seq. Health and Safety Code, Div. 2.5, 
Section 1797 et seq., and 1317. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Trauma patients should be secured and transported from the scene as quickly as 
possible, consistent with optimal trauma care. 
 
2. Paramedics shall make base hospital contact to the receiving trauma center on all 
injured patients who meet trauma triage criteria and/or guidelines.  Notification to the 
receiving trauma center shall be made whenever paramedic judgment determines 
transport to the trauma center is in the patient’s best interest. Contact shall be 
accomplished in such a way as not to delay transport. 
 
3. Do not delay transport of hypotensive patients with penetrating torso trauma in order to 
apply spinal motion restriction. 
 
4. EMT personnel may immediately transport hypotensive patients with life-threatening, 
penetrating injuries to the torso to the closest trauma center, not the Most Accessible 
Receiving (MAR), when the transport time is less than the estimated time of paramedic 
arrival. The transporting unit should make every effort to contact the receiving trauma 
center. 
 
5. When pediatric and adult trauma patients are transported together in one aircraft, the 
receiving trauma center shall be both a trauma center and a pediatric trauma center. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Trauma Criteria – Requires immediate transportation to a designated trauma center 
 
Patients who fall into one or more of the following categories are to be transported 
directly to the designated trauma center, if transport time does not exceed 30 minutes. 
 
A. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, or less than 70 mmHg in infants age 
less than one year 
 
B. Respiratory rate greater than 29 breaths/minute (sustained), less than 10 
breaths/minute, less than 20 breaths/minute in infants age less than one year, or 
requiring ventilatory support

PAGE 2 OF 5 
C. Cardiopulmonary arrest with penetrating torso trauma unless based upon the 
paramedic’s thorough assessment is found apneic, pulseless, asystolic, and 
without pupillary reflexes upon arrival of EMS personnel at the scene 
 
D. All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, and extremities proximal to the elbow 
or knee 
 
E. Blunt head injury associated with a suspected skull fracture, altered level of 
consciousness (Glasgow Coma Score less than or equal to 14), seizures, 
unequal pupils, or focal neurological deficit 
 
F. Injury to the spinal column associated with acute sensory or motor deficit 
 
G. Blunt injury to chest with unstable chest wall (flail chest) 
 
H. Diffuse abdominal tenderness 
 
I. Suspected pelvic fracture (excluding isolated hip fracture from a ground level fall) 
 
J. Extremity with: 
 
1. Neurological/vascular compromise and/or crushed, degloved, or mangled 
extremity 
 
2. Amputation proximal to the wrist or ankle 
 
3. Fractures of two or more proximal (humerus/femur) long-bones 
 
4. Bleeding not controlled by direct pressure requiring the usage of a 
hemorrhage control tourniquet or hemostatic agent (approved provider 
agencies only)  
 
K. Fall from height > 10 feet (all patients) 
 
L. Passenger space intrusion of greater than 12 inches into an occupied passenger 
space 
 
M. Ejected from vehicles (partial or complete) 
 
N. Auto versus pedestrian/bicyclist/motorcyclist thrown, run over, or with significant 
(greater than 20 mph) impact 
 
O. Unenclosed transport crash with significant (greater than 20 mph) impact 
 
P. Major / Critical Burn (excluding those in which the MAR is a recognized Burn 
Center, e.g., Los Angeles General Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Medical 
Center, West Hills Hospital): 
 
1. Patients 15 years of age or older with 2
nd
 (partial thickness) and 3
rd
 (full 
thickness) degree burns involving equal to or greater than 20% Total Body 
Surface Area (TBSA) 

SUBJECT: TRAUMA TRIAGE REFERENCE NO. 506 
 
PAGE 3 OF 5 
 
2. Patients ≤ 14 years of age with 2
nd
 (partial thickness) and 3
rd
 (full thickness) 
degree burns involving equal to or greater than 10% TBSA 
 
II. Trauma Guidelines – Mechanism of injury and patient history are the most effective 
methods of selecting critically injured patients before unstable vital signs develop. 
Paramedics and base hospital personnel should consider mechanism of injury and 
patient history when determining patient destination. At the discretion of the base 
hospital, transportation to a trauma center is advisable for: 
 
A. Passenger space intrusion of greater than 18 inches into any unoccupied 
passenger space 
 
B. Automobile versus pedestrian/bicyclist/motorcyclist (impact equal to or less than 
20 mph) 
 
C. Injured victims of vehicular crashes in which a fatality occurred in the same 
vehicle 
 
D. Patients requiring extrication 
 
E. Vehicle telemetry data consistent with high risk of injury 
 
F. Injured patients (excluding isolated minor extremity injuries): 
 
1. on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, other than aspirin-only 
 
2. with bleeding disorders 
 
III. Special Considerations – Consider transporting injured patients with the following to a 
trauma center: 
 
A. Patients in blunt traumatic full arrest who, based on a paramedic’s thorough 
patient assessment, was not found apneic, pulseless, and without organized ECG 
activity (narrow complex supraventricular rhythm) upon the arrival of EMS 
personnel at the scene 
 
B. Systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg may represent shock after age 65 
years 
 
C. Heart rate greater than systolic blood pressure for ≥ 14 years of age 
 
D. Child (0-9 years of age) unrestrained or in an unsecured child safety seat 
 
E. Pregnancy greater than 20 weeks gestation 
 
F. Prehospital judgment

IV. Extremis Patients - Requires immediate transportation to the MAR: 
 
A. Patients with an obstructed airway or those with concern for imminent airway 
obstruction due to inhalation injury 
 
B. Patients, as determined by the base hospital personnel, whose lives would be 
jeopardized by transportation to any destination but the MAR 
 
V. When, for whatever reason, base hospital contact cannot be made, the destination 
decision for injured patients will be made by paramedics using the principles set forth 
above. 
 
VI. 9-1-1 Trauma Re-Triage – This section applies to injured patients in emergency 
departments of non-trauma centers whose injuries were initially estimated by EMS to be 
less serious (under triaged) or patients who self-transported (walk-in) to a non-trauma 
center, and subsequently assessed by the non-trauma center physician to require 
immediate trauma center care. The referring facility shall utilize the procedure outlined 
below to expedite transfer arrangements and rapid transport to the trauma center. This 
process should be reserved for patients with life-threatening traumatic injuries requiring 
emergent surgical intervention. 
 
A. Determine if the injured patient meets any of the following 9-1-1 Trauma Re-
Triage criteria: 
 
1. Persistent signs of poor perfusion 
 
2. Need for immediate blood replacement therapy 
 
3. Intubation required 
 
4. Glasgow Coma Score less than 9 
 
5. Glasgow Coma Score deteriorating by 2 or more points during 
observation 
 
6. Penetrating injuries to head, neck and torso 
 
7. Extremity injury with neurovascular compromise or loss of pulses 
 
8. Patients, who in the judgement of the evaluating emergency physician, 
have high likelihood of requiring emergent life- or limb-saving intervention 
within two (2) hours. 
 
B. Contact the designated receiving trauma center or pediatric trauma center if the 
patient is less than or equal to 14 years of age and transport does not exceed 30 
min. Do not delay transfer by initiating any diagnostic procedures that do not 
have direct impact on immediate resuscitative measures. 
 
C. Contact 9-1-1 for transportation. The paramedic scope of practice (Ref. No. 803) 
does not include paralyzing agents. Paramedics can monitor infusion of blood 
products that have been started by the transferring hospital prior to transport.

D. Prepare patient and available medical records for immediate transport. Do not 
delay transport for medical records which could be sent at a later time.
