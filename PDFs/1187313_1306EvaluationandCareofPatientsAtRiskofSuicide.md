Medical Control Guideline: EVALUATION AND CARE OF PATIENTS AT RISK OF SUICIDE  
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Suicide Risk Screening: A standardized method to identify individuals who may be at risk for 
suicide, and to estimate a patient’s current level of risk for suicide by asking specific questions 
about a patient’s thoughts and behaviors.  
 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS, https://cssrs.columbia.edu/) (MCG 
1306.1) is an example of a commonly used, evidence-based method of suicide risk screening 
that can be administered by a variety of personnel, such as all healthcare personnel, law 
enforcement personnel, educators, clergy, and the lay public.  
 
Suicide Risk Assessment: A thorough and systematic evaluation that is typically performed 
after suicide risk screening. A trained mental health clinician (e.g., a psychiatrist, social worker, 
or psychologist in an ED or PUCC setting) performs a detailed clinical assessment to confirm 
suspected suicide risk, to estimate the immediate danger, and to delineate treatment.  
Assessment takes into account chronic and acute risk factors, protective factors, and medical 
and mental health history. 
 
Suicidal Ideation (SI):  Thoughts of death or ending one’s life. Different types of SI include the 
following (in increasing level of severity):  
 
Passive SI: A wish to be dead or to go to sleep and not wake-up (C-SSRS Q1) 
Active SI: Actual thoughts of wanting to kill oneself 
(C-SSRS Q2) 
Suicide Method: Contemplation of one or more ways or means of 
ending their life, without formulating a specific plan  
(C-SSRS Q3) 
Suicidal Intent: Intention to act on suicidal thoughts or behaviors, with 
the specific goal to kill oneself or to die  
(C-SSRS Q4) 
Suicide Plan: Specific thoughts of converting a method to a plan, such 
as deciding on the timing, location, and/or preparations to end their life 
(e.g., gathering pills, acquiring a weapon, writing a suicide note, 
researching the location for a traumatic/deadly injury)  
(C-SSRS Q5) 
 
 
Suicide Attempt: A self-injurious behavior where a person specifically intends to die (C-SSRS 
Q6) 
 
Suicide: Death caused by self-injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of that behavior.   
(Note: The following terms are discouraged from use: “completed suicide”, “successful suicide”, 
and “failed suicide”. Preferred terms are “suicide” and “suicide attempt”.)  
 
Self-injurious behaviors:  Behaviors in which a person intentionally harms themselves, with or 
without intent to die (a patient’s intent to die must be specifically asked, or implied).  For 
example, patients may “self-harm” (e.g., cutting, burning, or punching oneself), without intent to 
die, as a way of attempting to cope with emotional distress or psychological pain.   
 
Suicidal behaviors: Self-injurious behavior with the intent to die.

Safety Planning: Interventions made by healthcare personnel, first responders, or others, to 
reduce the patient’s risk of suicide or self-harm.  
 
5150 / 5585 (AKA “Hold”, “Psychiatric Hold”, “Mental Health Hold”, or “LPS Hold”): 
Refers to California Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) section 5150 et seq. which describes 
the legal standard for involuntary detainment and evaluation of a person who, as a result of a 
mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to themselves, or gravely disabled. “5150” 
refers to the code for adult patients, “5585” refers to the code for minors (under age 18). 
 
Danger to Self: The term used in CA WIC 5150 et seq, to define probable cause for detaining a 
patient involuntarily for the purpose of evaluation, who as a result of a mental illness poses a 
risk to themselves (e.g., has suicidal ideation or behavior).   
 
LPS-Evaluator: An individual that is authorized under CA WIC 5150 et seq. to evaluate and 
place a patient on a 5150/5585 hold application, such as all law enforcement (LE) personnel 
and clinicians who are LPS-authorized by the County Department of Mental Health. Examples 
include: Psychiatric Emergency Team (PET), Psychiatric Mobile Response Team (PMRT), 
Mental Evaluation Team (MET), Systemwide Mental Assessment Response Teams (SMART), 
or others). LPS refers to “Lanterman-Petris-Short”, the names of the original state legislators 
who authored the CA WIC 5150 et seq. code. 
 
LPS facility: Treatment facilities that are specifically designated by the county for mental health 
evaluation and treatment, approved by the State Department of Health Care Services, and 
licensed as a health facility as defined in the CA Health and Safety Code (subdivision (a) or (b) 
of Section 1250 or 1250.2).  
 
Against Medical Advice (AMA): A patient, or a legal representative of a patient, who has 
decision-making capacity and who refuses treatment and/or transport for an emergency 
medical condition as advised by EMS providers, physician on scene, and/or Base personnel.  
 
Decision-Making Capacity: The ability to understand the nature and consequences of 
proposed health care. This includes understanding the significant risks and benefits, and having 
the ability to make and communicate a decision regarding the proposed health care in the 
patient’s primary language, if feasible. A person has decision-making capacity if they are able 
to: 
• Communicate the need for treatment, the implications of receiving and of not 
receiving treatment, and alternative forms of treatment that are available, and 
• Relate the above information to their personal values, and then make and convey a 
decision. 
A person may lack decision-making capacity as follows:  
• Temporarily lost (e.g., due to unconsciousness, influence of mind-altering 
substances, mental illness, or cognitive impairment) 
• Permanently lost (e.g., due to irreversible coma, persistent vegetative state, 
untreatable brain injury, or dementia) 
• Never existed (i.e., due to profound neurodevelopmental or medical disorder), 
• Legally determined to lack capacity (i.e. persons who are deemed incompetent by a 
Court, or a person under conservatorship) 
 
9-8-8: The three digit emergency number for the 24/7 National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline that 
provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional 
distress.

PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Psychiatric emergencies (including those related to mental health and substance abuse) 
are emergent clinical conditions, and as such are best treated by EMS personnel who 
are trained, equipped, and experienced to evaluate and manage such patients. 
 
2. Suicide risk screening, through history taking and assessment, can be performed by 
EMS personnel during the evaluation of patients who express suicidal ideation or 
behaviors. Several suicide risk screening tools, which are evidence-based and validated 
in other settings, may be used to assist. 
 
3. CA WIC 5150 et seq. defines the situations when a patient may be involuntarily detained 
and transported on a psychiatric hold, and who is authorized to issue a psychiatric hold. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Evaluate the patient for medical conditions immediately if the patient has made a suicide 
attempt or is suspected of making a suicide attempt. Manage medical conditions with the 
appropriate treatment protocol based on provider impression. 
 
2. Evaluate primary psychiatric crises by obtaining relevant clinical history and managing 
per treatment protocol (TP 1209 or 1209-P, Behavioral/Psychiatric Crisis). 
 
3. Establish rapport with the patient to facilitate trust and open communication and to 
optimize the evaluation and screening of suicide risk. 
 
4. Inquire about the patient’s suicidal ideation and behaviors, including whether the patient 
has passive SI, active SI, contemplation of suicide method, intent to die by suicide, a 
plan to commit suicide, and/or suicide attempts. 
 
A. To assist with evaluating the level of suicide risk, a suicide risk screening tool 
such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (C-SSRS) can be used to 
administer standardized screening questions (MCG 1306.1). 
 
B. If using the C-SSRS, questions should be asked verbatim, all instructions should 
be followed, and attention paid to the specified time frames. 
 
5. Evaluate the reliability of information, especially in situations where a patient may be 
suspected of minimizing or evading questions about SI or suicidal behaviors.  
 
A. Obtain information from key third parties when feasible.   
 
B. Document if the patient lacks capacity or is unwilling to participate in the 
evaluation. 
 
6. When a patient has been evaluated by an authorized LPS-Evaluator regarding 
placement of a 5150/5585 hold, that evaluation shall generally take precedence in 
determining whether a patient can be transported involuntarily. 
 
A. Exceptions include when the EMS provider determines that the patient has a 
medical need that requires transport to a medical facility and lacks decision-

making capacity (e.g., need for evaluation for trauma or other emergency 
physical conditions).  
 
B. If concern for suicidal intent in persons that do not meet criteria for a 5150/5585 
hold as determined by an LPS evaluator, and refusing voluntary treatment or 
transport, EMS should contact base contact to discuss patient disposition. 
 
C. For recommendations regarding patient disposition, refer to MCG 1306.2. 
 
7. In situations where there may be disagreement with LE or an LPS-evaluator regarding 
the placement or non-placement of a 5150/5585 hold, and/or transport that cannot be 
resolved, the following steps should be taken: 
 
A. EMS provider shall contact higher authority (e.g., EMS Captain or Battalion 
Chief) to seek resolution, which may be facilitated by a call with the LE or LPS 
higher authorities.  
 
B. LE provider should contact higher authority (e.g., Field supervisor or Watch 
commander). 
 
C. LPS evaluators (such as PET, SMART, MET) should contact higher authority. 
 
D. Base Contact can be initiated to mediate discussion between LE and EMS, 
including discussion of suicide risk screening outcomes for both parties. 
 
E. In cases of continued disagreement, LE or LPS evaluator determination takes 
precedence as they are the legal authority for placement or non-placement of a 
5150/5585 hold. 
 
8. EMS clinicians can perform safety planning to help reduce the patient’s risk of suicide or 
self-harm with the following interventions: 
 
A. Establish mental health services: Provide the national suicide lifeline phone 
number (9-8-8), and recommend the patient call their mental health provider, or 
take steps to establish mental health care (e.g., LA County Department of Mental 
Health 800-854-7771, or contact their insurance provider) 
 
B. Help the patient identify support contacts: Identify a family member, friend or 
other trusted individual who they can reach out to for help and recommend that 
they be accompanied or supported in the short term. 
 
C. Reduce access to suicide means: Provide direction to the patient or key third 
parties (e.g., family, friends) to remove or secure any identified or potential 
means of suicide, especially firearms, knives, pills, or other toxins.   
 
Firearms can be secured through use of gun locks, storage lockers, or 
transferred to family or friend for safekeeping.  LE personnel can also be 
contacted to advise about securing firearms.   
 
D. Reduce the risk of alcohol or drugs: Recommend that the patient avoid use of 
alcohol or any other drugs, and/or take steps to limit their availability.
