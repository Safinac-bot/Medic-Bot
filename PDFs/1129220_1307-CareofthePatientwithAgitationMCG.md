Medical Control Guideline: Care of the Patient with Agitation 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
Agitation: A hyper-aroused state (ranging in severity from anxious and cooperative to violent 
and combative) in which the individual exhibits excessive, repeated, and purposeless motor or 
verbal behaviors (e.g., pacing, fidgeting, clenching fists or teeth, prolonged staring, picking at 
clothing or skin, responding to internal stimuli such as hallucinations, threatening or carrying out 
violent acts).  
 
Delirium: An acute change in mental state due to an underlying medical condition characterized 
by confusion, disorientation, reduced awareness of the environment, and disordered thinking. 
 
Autism Spectrum Disorder: A disorder diagnosed in childhood, but continuing into adulthood, 
with a wide range of severity involving difficulty with social communication and interaction, 
repetitive patterns of behavior, and narrowed interests or activities. Some patients have very 
little ability to communicate, or comprehend verbal and nonverbal communication, while others 
may communicate and are intelligent.  Individuals are often sensitive (fearful/reactive) to 
environmental stimulation and depend on routines. 
 
Bipolar Disorder: An episodic illness in which patients experience periods of elation or “high” 
mood (mania or hypomania), and periods of depression. Manic episodes are characterized by 
decreased sleep, lots of energy, rapid speech and ideas, impulsive and reckless decision-
making (e.g., buying expensive objects, quitting a job, going on sudden unplanned trips) and an 
inflated view of oneself (grandiosity).   
 
Delusion: A false belief that is firmly held despite objective and obvious contradictory proof or 
evidence.  Delusions can be dangerous when the patient has a fixed idea that causes them to 
act violently.  
 
Dementia: An illness generally diagnosed in older adults, associated with progressive cognitive 
decline including memory loss and an inability to carry out tasks or basic functions (i.e., driving, 
using a phone, dressing/grooming).  The condition ranges in severity with some patients having 
little ability to speak, communicate, to those with less severe forms may be able to communicate 
well and manage their own care needs.  
 
Major Depressive Disorder: An episodic illness in which a person feels profound sadness, a 
lack of enjoyment, and other symptoms that may include impairments in sleep, energy, appetite, 
motivation, concentration, and socialization.  These patients often feel hopeless and are 
especially likely to think about or try to commit suicide. 
 
Disorganized behaviors:  A set of behaviors or actions that do not appear to accomplish 
anything meaningful (e.g., laughing to self, lying motionless and unresponsive to people around 
them, pacing or repeatedly sitting/standing without any clear reason, staring at the wall, or 
object with a blank expression). They can be seen with a variety of conditions including 
psychosis, autism, dementia, and mania. 
 
Disorganized Speech: A speech pattern that is extremely difficult to follow, such as garbled or 
non-sense speech, telling a story that jumps illogically from one topic to the next, making up 
new words, or highly repetitive speech (e.g., muttering to self with repetitive phrases).

Hallucinations:  Patients experience sensing things that other people cannot hear, see, or 
smell (infrequent). Most commonly this means a patient is “hearing voices” or “seeing things”. 
This can be dangerous if the patient is experiencing hallucinations that command them to harm 
themselves, other people, or carry out dangerous acts. Hallucinations can be a symptom of 
psychosis or drug intoxication, but can be associated with other conditions like mania, 
depression, dementia and delirium. 
 
Iatrogenic escalation: Escalation of a patient’s agitated state caused by EMS / healthcare 
personnel either inadvertently, or deliberately, by acting in ways that the patient does not expect 
or desire (e.g., restricting a patient’s freedom to move (cornering the patient), taking away 
patient belongings or invalidating, confronting, arguing with, or intimidating a patient).   
 
Intellectual Disability: A range of disability from mild to severe, characterized by significant 
limitations in intellectual functioning (learning, reasoning, problem solving, planning) and 
adaptive behavior (everyday social skills like communication, and practical skills like living 
independently).  
 
Paranoia: A state of suspicion or mistrust of people or institutions, such as hospitals/healthcare 
personnel, law enforcement or security. 
 
Psychosis: A state where a person loses contact with reality.  Common diagnoses or terms of 
psychotic illness include: “Schizophrenia”, “Psychotic disorder”, “Acute psychotic episode”, 
“Schizoaffective disorder” (a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), “delusional 
disorder”.  The symptoms of a psychotic illness are commonly: hallucinations, delusions, 
paranoia and/or disorganized behaviors and speech.  
  
Self-injurious behaviors: Behaviors or violent acts directed at oneself, occurring in many 
psychiatric disorders which may include depression or bipolar disorder, psychosis, drug abuse, 
and personality disorder (patients are often trying to distract themselves from extreme emotional 
pain they feel).  (Also referred to as: Non-suicidal self-injury) 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Psychiatric emergencies, including those related to mental health and substance abuse, 
are medical emergencies, and as such are best treated by EMS personnel who are 
trained, equipped, and experienced to evaluate and manage medical patients. 
 
2. A proportion of prehospital psychiatric emergencies involve acute behavioral agitation, 
violence, threats of harm to self or others, or criminal activity. Such patients are best 
managed by an EMS and law enforcement (LE) co-response.  
 
3. The overarching goal in management of acute behavioral agitation is to help the patient 
regain control over their behaviors so that they can participate in their evaluation and 
treatment. 
 
4. EMS personnel should maintain the patient’s dignity to the extent possible, including use 
of the least restrictive method of restraint or intervention to facilitate clinical patient 
assessment, medically indicated treatment, and safe transport to a hospital. 
 
5. Agitation has varying presentations on a spectrum, ranging in severity from anxious and 
cooperative to violent and combative. The patient may not have the ability to understand 
the situation or the dangers of their behavior or comply with directions because they lack 
insight and/or self-awareness.

6. The potential causes of agitation are numerous and varied and can include medical 
and/or psychiatric and/or substance abuse conditions.  Agitation can also be unrelated to 
a medical/psychiatric condition, in such cases agitation may be used by a person 
“instrumentally” as a means of achieving a goal.   
 
7. Physical restraint and pharmacologic management of agitation when providing EMS 
care are primarily indicated to protect a patient, the public, and other EMS personnel 
from injury.  
 
8. The decision for EMS personnel to use pharmacologic intervention to treat agitation is a 
critical health care decision. (Note: “chemical restraint” is not a preferred terms). 
Medications with sedating effects administered during or after application of restraints 
has the potential to exacerbate acidosis and asphyxia. 
 
9. Persons who lack decision-making capacity, or unaccompanied minors, are assessed 
and treated with implied consent (Ref. No. 834 – Patient Refusal of Treatment/Transport 
and Treat and Release at Scene). 
 
10. LE officers, whenever available, should be involved in cases in which a patient poses a 
threat to themselves, the public, and/or EMS personnel.  
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Initial Approach to Scene Safety: 
A. Evaluation of the agitated patient should start from a safe and sensible distance (See 
MCGs 1307.1 and 1307.2).  
 
B. If EMS personnel are in danger of harm, they should retreat to a safe location and 
await the arrival of LE. 
i. Safety is paramount and at no time should EMS personnel jeopardize 
their safety by engaging with an agitated patient unless they feel that they 
have the knowledge, tools, and skills to do so. 
 
C. The first EMS and/or LE responders should organize their approach by identifying a 
lead who is responsible for communicating with the patient and coordinating the 
actions of the rest of the team. 
 
D. If there is no safe option for retreat, EMS personnel who are being physically 
attacked may defend themselves as permitted by local law. EMS personnel should 
not show aggression or retaliate against the patient. 
 
E. The goals of EMS care are to determine whether the patient is a candidate for verbal 
de-escalation (the preferred first step in managing agitation), if physical restraint is 
indicated, if pharmacologic intervention is indicated, and ultimately to provide an 
assessment for acute medical and psychiatric conditions. 
 
F. The flowchart in MCG 1307.1 describes the initial approach to the scene of an 
agitated patient. 
 
 
2. Verbal De-escalation: 
 
A. All EMS personnel shall be trained, capable, and competent in verbal de-escalation 
techniques, (e.g., using the “ERASER” mnemonic, see MCG 1307.2).

REVISED: 07-01-25 PAGE 4 OF 5 
 
B. The use of appropriate de-escalation techniques should take precedence and be 
attempted prior to physical restraint and/or administration of pharmacologic 
management, whenever possible and clinically appropriate. 
 
C. EMS personnel should not directly question or confront a patient’s psychotic 
symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, or behaviors) as it may worsen 
the patient’s agitation.  
 
D. EMS personnel should remain self-aware and not allow themselves to react to 
provocative patients because this can lead to iatrogenic escalation of agitation.  
 
3. Assessment of Agitation: 
 
A. EMS personnel shall attempt to perform an appropriate patient assessment to 
identify and manage clinical conditions that may be contributing to a patient’s 
agitated, combative, or violent behavior.  The table in MCG 1307.3 describes 
potential clinical scenarios where a patient presents with agitation and provides 
guidance on use of verbal de-escalation. 
 
4. Pharmacologic management may be required for the safety of the patient, EMS 
personnel and/or public when verbal de-escalation techniques are ineffective (TP 1209 
or 1209-P,Behavioral/Psychiatric Crisis).  
 
A. Apnea may occur rapidly and without warning after pharmacologic intervention. 
 
B. Patient monitoring should be implemented any time parenteral pharmacologic 
intervention is performed. Resuscitation and monitoring equipment, including oxygen 
and bag valve mask, should be positioned near the patient and readily accessible 
prior to proceeding with sedation. Monitoring of pulse oximetry, cardiac rhythm, 
and capnography (when available) should be implemented as soon as possible and 
prior to initiation of transport.  
 
C. Monitoring is not required for agitated patients who are cooperative and voluntarily 
accept oral medications.  
 
5. Use of Restraints: 
 
A. If determined that the patient is not an appropriate candidate for verbal de-escalation 
(i.e., after failed attempts at verbal de-escalation, or acute medical situation requires 
immediate intervention) or when managing a patient who re-escalates to agitated 
behavior after verbal de-escalation, physical restraint may be required in conjunction 
with pharmacologic management (Ref. No. 838, Application of Patient Restraints).  
 
6. Co-Response with Law Enforcement: 
 
A. At all times, EMS personnel should act as an advocate for the safety, medical 
monitoring, and clinical care of the patient. 
 
B. In some situations, it may be necessary for LE to apply restraint techniques or 
interventions (e.g., handcuffs or flex cuffs, herein referred to as LE restraint). 
a. Patients requiring ongoing care and/or EMS transport that are in LE restraints 
shall be managed in accordance with Ref. No. 838, Application of Patient

Restraints, with preference for discontinuing LE restraint in favor of EMS 
approved restraint interventions when appropriate. 
 
C. Patients who are in LE custody or who are under arrest must always have a LE 
officer present or immediately available during EMS transport.
