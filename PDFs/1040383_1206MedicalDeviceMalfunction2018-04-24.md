SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Most patients with an inserted medical device have medical complaints that are not related to the 
device itself and should be treated as per standard protocols based on presenting signs and 
symptoms. It is important to obtain a history of when the medical device was inserted as different 
complications occur depending on time since insertion.  
 
❷   Patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts can have breakage of the shunt connections, obstruction, or 
infection of the shunt, which may present as ALOC, headache, nausea and vomiting, or fever.
