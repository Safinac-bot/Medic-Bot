BACKGROUND: Despite the benefits of targeted temperature management (TTM) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest), implementa-
tion within the United States remains low. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and factors associated 
with TTM use in a large, urban-suburban regional system of care.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective analysis from the Los Angeles County regional cardiac system of care serving 
a population of >10 million residents. All adult patients aged ≥18 years with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest trans-
ported to a cardiac arrest center from April 2011 to August 2017 were included. Patients awake and alert in the emergency 
department and patients who died in the emergency department before consideration for TTM were excluded. The primary 
outcome measure was prevalence of TTM use. The secondary analysis were annual trends in TTM use over the study period 
and factors associated with TTM use. The study population included 8072 patients; 4154 patients (51.5%) received TTM and 
3767 patients (46.7%) did not receive TTM. Median age was 67 years, 4780 patients (59.2%) were men, 4645 patients (57.5%) 
were  non-White,  and  the  most  common  arrest  location  was  personal  residence  in  4841  patients  (60.0%).  In  the  adjusted  
analysis, younger age, male sex, an initial shockable rhythm, witnessed arrest, and receiving coronary angiography were as-
sociated with receiving TTM.
CONCLUSIONS: Within this regional system of care, use of TTM was higher than previously reported in the literature at just over 
50%. Use of integrated systems of care may be a novel method to increase TTM use within the United States.

T
he  annual  incidence  of  out-of-hospital  cardiac  
arrest  (OHCA)  in  the  United  States  is  nearly  
400  000,  with  large  regional  variation  in  sur-
vival to hospital discharge ranging from 3.4% to 22% 
and  survival  with  good  neurologic  outcome  ranging  
from  0.8%  to  20%.

  Randomized  studies  support  
the use of targeted temperature management (TTM) 
for  patients  with  return  of  spontaneous  circulation  
(ROSC)  following  OHCA  from  shockable  ryhthms.
2,3
 
Observational studies, a single randomized trial and 
recent practice guidelines also encourage the use of 
TTM for non-shockable rhythms.

 Despite its bene-
fits, recent publications suggest that TTM is underuti-
lized in the United States.

Hermel et al TTM and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
Regionalization of care with dedicated cardiac care 
centers for OHCA has been independently associated 
with  increased  overall  survival  and  favorable  neuro-
logic outcomes.

 Characterization of TTM in regional 
systems  of  care  has  not  been  adequately  described.  
The objective of the current study was to evaluate the 
prevalence and factors associated with TTM use in a 
large, urban-suburgan regional system of care, as well 
as describe trends in TTM use over time.
METHODS
Los Angeles County Emergency Medical 
Services Registry
This  is  a  retrospective  study  of  data  from  the  Los  
Angeles County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
registry.  The  study  was  approved  with  waiver  of  in-
formed consent by the Institutional Review Board at 
the  University  of  Southern  California.  The  data  that  
support the findings of this study are available from 
the corresponding author upon reasonable request. 
Prior reports have described the regional system of 
care in Los Angeles County, which currently includes 
36  designated  cardiac  arrest  receiving  centers.
13 –15
 
Los  Angeles  County  has  a  population  of  >10.2  mil-
lion with EMS provided by 30 municipal fire depart-
ments  and  1  law  enforcement  agency  with  ≈3900  
licensed paramedics. The Los Angeles County EMS 
Agency  provides  oversight  of  providers  operating  
within  the  county,  establishes  protocols  and  proce-
dures, and designates specialty care centers. Since 
2011, countywide protocols mandate transport of all 
OHCA  patients  of  presumed  cardiac  etiology  with  
ROSC in the field to a cardiac arrest center with an 
institutionally  approved  TTM  protocol  and  the  abil-
ity  to  provide  24/7  emergent  coronary  angiography  
and  percutaneous  coronary  intervention  (PCI).  At  
the onset of the system of care in 2011, participating 
hospitals  were  encouraged  to  institute  TTM  with  a  
target temperature of 32°C to 34°C within 6 hours of 
ROSC and to maintain it for a minimum of 20 hours. 
In  September  2016,  this  policy  was  revised  to  en-
courage temperature control between 32°C to 36°C 
for at least 24 hours. The final decision to initiate or 
withhold  TTM  was  guided  by  individual  institutional  
policy and at the discretion of the treating physician 
at the local hospital. TTM was not initiated in the field 
and the specific method for TTM (endovascular cool-
ing, cooling blankets, etc) was not mandated.
Los  Angeles  County  EMS  policy  encourages  re-
suscitation on scene to achieve ROSC before trans-
port.  For  patients  meeting  criteria,  termination  of  
resuscitation in the field is supported by official policy 
since 2007. Termination of resuscitation is based on 
medical futility determined by paramedics in consul-
tation  with  online  medical  direction  and  agreement  
of  immediate  family  on  scene.  Since  April  2011,  all  
cardiac arrest centers have reported demographics, 
in-hospital  mortality,  and  neurologic  outcome  to  a  
registry maintained by the Los Angeles County EMS 
Agency.
Study Population
This database was queried from April 2011 through 
August 2017, representing all available data at the time 
of analysis. Patients aged ≥18 years resuscitated from 
OHCA that were transported to a designated cardiac 
arrest center were included. Patients with traumatic 
cardiac  arrest  and  those  aged  <18  years  were  ex-
cluded. Additionally, patients who would not benefit 
from  TTM  were  excluded  from  the  analysis  to  miti-
gate the selection bias toward or against TTM given 
the  observational  design  of  the  study.  We  therefore  
excluded patients awake and alert in the emergency 
department (ED) and patients who died in the ED be-
fore consideration for TTM. Patients with termination 
of  resuscitation  in  the  field  were  not  transported  by  
protocol and, therefore, were not eligible for inclusion 
in the data registry nor this current study.
CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
What Is New?
•  Targeted  temperature  management  (TTM)  is  
beneficial for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with 
return of spontaneous circulation but is underu-
tilized within the United States.
• Prior studies have not evaluated the in-hospital 
use  of  TTM  within  regional  cardiac  systems  of  
care.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
•  TTM  use  significantly  increased  from  49.4%  in  
2011 to 55.7% in 2017.
•  Younger  age,  male  sex,  an  initial  shockable  
rhythm,  witnessed  arrest,  and  receiving  coro-
nary angiography were associated with receiv-
ing TTM.
• Use of integrated cardiac systems of care may 
be a novel method to increase TTM use within 
the United States.

Hermel et al TTM and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
Individual  centers  are  responsible  for  data  collec-
tion. Staff members charged with data entry abstract 
the data points from the medical record, including the 
prehospital care records. Greater than 90% of staff re-
sponsible for data extraction and entry are registered 
nurses  in  the  departments  of  emergency  medicine,  
cardiology,  and  quality  improvement.  Completeness  
and  accuracy  of  the  entered  data  are  continually  re-
viewed by the Los Angeles County EMS Agency with 
verification  performed  during  annual  site  visits.  Bi-
annual system-wide meetings are held for data review.
Covariates and Definitions
Study variables included age, sex, race/ethnicity, loca-
tion of arrest, initial rhythm, witness to arrest, bystander 
cardiopulmonary  resuscitation,  ST-segment‒elevation 
myocardial  infarction  on  the  prehospital  or  first  ECG  
in the ED, coronary angiography, PCI and the location 
where  TTM  was  initiated  (ED,  cardiac  catheterization  
laboratory,  intensive  care  unit).  Initial  rhythm  refers  
to  the  first  rhythm  documented  by  prehospital  per-
sonnel  and  includes  ventricular  fibrillation,  ventricular  
tachycardia, shocks advised by an automated external 
defibrillator  (presumed  ventricular  tachycardia  or  ven-
tricular fibrillation), asystole, and pulseless electrical ac-
tivity. Shockable rhythms were classified as ventricular 
fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and shocks advised 
by an automated external defibrillator. Non-shockable 
rhythms  were  classified  as  asystole  and  pulseless  
electrical  activity.  The  reasons  that  TTM  was  not  ini-
tiated  were  categorized  according  to  the  data  in  the  
registry including an existing do not resuscitate order, 
other rationale not otherwise specified, persistent hy-
potension, active bleeding, terminal illness, core tem-
perature  <35°C,  preexisting  coma,  and  other  relative  
contraindications.  These  rationale  were  documented  
by the treating hospital and more than 1 reason could 
be documented on 1 patient.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the prevalence of TTM use 
in  patients  with  OHCA  and  ROSC  treated  at  cardiac  
arrest  receiving  centers  within  this  regional  system  of  
care. The secondary analyses were to describe trends 
in  TTM  use  over  time  and  explore  factors  associated  
with  TTM  use.  We  also  evaluated  the  association  of  
TTM  with  survival  to  hospital  discharge  and  survival  
with  good  neurologic  outcome,  defined  as  cerebral  
performance category (CPC) 1 or 2.
Statistical Analysis
We  conducted  all  analyses  using  SAS,  version  9.4,  
(SAS  institute  Cary,  NC).  Patient  characteristics  were  
determined  for  the  entire  cohort  and  stratified  by  
treatment  with  TTM.  Descriptive  statistics  were  sum-
marized  using  medians  and  interquartile  ranges  or  
frequencies and proportions. Groups were compared 
with  the  Hodges-Lehmann  or  Chi  square  test  as  ap-
propriate. An exploratory analysis of predictors of TTM 
use  was  performed.  All  potential  predictors  available  
in the dataset (age, sex, race, shockable rhythm, wit-
nessed  arrest,  bystander  cardiopulmonary  resuscita-
tion, and receiving coronary angiography and PCI) were 
included and a backwards selection logistic regression 
was  conducted  using  a  generalized  estimating  equa-
tion and a backward elimination technique, which also 
accounted  for  clustering  by  hospital.  A  test  for  collin-
earity of variables was done in the multivariate models. 
There  was  no  indication  of  collinearity  for  any  of  the  
variables, based on the observation that the variance 
inflation factor was <10 for all variables. Predictors were 
retained at an alpha of 0.05. The annual trend in TTM 
use was evaluated using the Cochran-Armitage Trend 
Test. Unadjusted survival to hospital discharge and un-
adjusted survival to hospital discharge with good neu-
rologic outcome (CPC 1 or 2), were determined for the 
entire cohort and for those receiving and not receiving 
TTM. Logistic regression analysis for survival to hospi-
tal discharge with good neurologic outcome (CPC 1 or 
2) with versus without TTM was performed, adjusting 
for age, sex, race, initial shockable rhythm, witnessed 
arrest,  bystander  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation,  and  
receiving coronary angiography and PCI.
R ES U LTS
From April 2011 to August 2017 there were 12 238 pa-
tients with OHCA and ROSC in the registry, of whom 
8072  were  eligible  for  TTM  and  make  up  the  study  
cohort  (Figure  1).  TTM  was  initiated  in  4154  patients  
(51.5%) and was not initiated in 3767 patients (46.7%). 
For the entire cohort, median age was 67 years (inter-
quartile range, 56 to 79 years), 4780 patients (59.2%) 
were  men,  3427  patients  (42.5%)  were  White,  and  
1997  patients  (24.7%)  were  Hispanic  (Table  1).  The  
most common location of OHCA was a personal resi-
dence  in  4841  patients  (60.0%)  and  a  skilled  nursing  
facility in 1216 patients (15.1%). The initial rhythm was 
ventricular  tachycardia/ventricular  fibrillation  in  2184  
patients (27.1%) and a non-shockable rhythm in 5303 
patients (65.7%). Bystander was the witness to arrest 
in  5404  patients  (67.0%).  Bystander  cardiopulmonary  
resuscitation  occurred  in  3306  patients  (41.0%).  ST-
segment‒elevation  myocardial  infarction  was  present  
in 1137 patients (14.1%) and coronary angiography and 
PCI were performed in 1480 patients (18.3%) and 779 
patients (9.7%), respectively. For patients who received 
TTM, it was initiated in the ED in 2627 patients (63.2%) 
and in the intensive care unit in 1264 patients (30.4%).

Hermel et al TTM and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
In  univariate  analysis,  patients  receiving  TTM  were  
more  likely  to  be  younger,  men,  non-White,  with  lo-
cation of arrest in a personal residence, had an initial 
shockable  rhythm,  had  bystander  witnessed  arrest,  
and  were  more  likely  to  present  with  ST-segment‒el-
evation  myocardial  infarction,  and  undergo  coronary  
angiography  and  PCI  (Table  1).  Patients  not  receiving  
TTM  were  more  likely  to  have  the  arrest  occur  in  a  
skilled nursing facility. There was a significant increase 
in  the  use  of  TTM  from  2011  to  2017,  from  49.4%  to  
55.7%, P value for trend was 0.005. (Table S1).
The  reasons  TTM  was  not  initiated  are  listed  in  
Table  2.  The  most  common  reasons  were  an  exist-
ing  do  not  resuscitate  order  in  716  patients  (19.0%),  
other rationale not otherwise specified in 629 patients 
(16.7%),  and  persistent  hypotension  in  481  patients  
(12.8%). A significant number of patients had no reason 
documented  (645  patients,  17.1%).  In  the  exploratory  
analysis of factors associated with TTM use, an initial 
shockable  rhythm,  witnessed  arrest,  and  receiving  
coronary angiography were associated with receiving 
TTM (Figure 2). In contrast, female sex and increasing 
age were associated with not receiving TTM.
Survival  to  hospital  discharge  was  34.1%  for  the  
entire cohort. Survival to hospital discharge was 41.3% 
and 25.9% for those receiving and not receiving TTM, 
respectively.  Among  survivors,  survival  to  hospital  
discharge  with  CPC  1  or  2  was  47.7%  overall,  and  
54.2% and 38.6% for those receiving and not receiving 
TTM, respectively. TTM was associated with improved 
odds  of  survival  to  hospital  discharge  with  CPC  1  
or  2;  adjusted  odds  ratio,  1.71;  95%  CI,  1.40  to  2.09  
(Table S2).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we report a contemporary analy-
sis of a large regional system of care for OHCA that in-
cludes 36 hospitals serving a population of >10 million 
individuals. The study population was ethnically diverse 
with a high proportion of Hispanics and a high preva-
lence of women. We found the prevalence of TTM use 
to be ≈51% and observed a significant increase in TTM 
use over the study period. Further, we identified several 
patient and arrest characteristics that were associated 
with the use of TTM. Of note, we applied broad inclu-
sion  criteria,  excluding  only  those  who  arrived  awake  
and alert and those who died in the ED before the ini-
tiation of TTM. We chose these criteria in an attempt to 
make relevant observations about the true clinical use 
of TTM in this regional system of care.
Although  TTM  after  OHCA  has  been  associated  
with improved survival and neurologic outcomes, it re-
mains underutilized in the United States.
9,11,16 ,17
 An ini-
tial publication by Patel et al using the National Inpatient 
Sample found that <1% of patients received TTM.
9
 In a 
more recent analysis from the same data set, Dresden 
et al found that the prevalence of TTM use increased to 
2.5% in 2010 with significant variation among hospitals 
and geographic locations.
11
 Despite the challenges of 
characterizing  TTM  use  with  an  administrative  data-
base, these markedly low rates suggest infrequent use 
nationally.
Studies  using  CARES  (Cardiac  Arrest  Registry  to  
Enhance Survival) reported higher use of TTM. Coute 
et al reported on 8115 patients included in CARES from 
the  state  of  Michigan  from  2014  to  2015  and  found  
variable  use  of  TTM  by  hospitals,  ranging  from  29%  
to  68%.
16
  In  a  larger  analysis  from  CARES  including  
>45 000 patients treated at 649 hospitals throughout 
the United States from 2013 to 2016, overall TTM use 
was 46%.
17
 These rates of TTM use are similar to our 
results from the Los Angeles regional cardiac care sys-
tem. However, EMS systems and hospitals self-select 
to contribute to CARES, and may achieve greater out-
comes  than  their  non-participating  peers  and  so  are  
not  representative  of  the  true  national  prevalence  of  
TTM use. A more recent study by Khera et al reported 
Figure 1. Study flow diagram.

  These  data  
may provide a better estimate of TTM use throughout 
the United States. Notably, there was significant hos-
pital  variation  and,  unlike  in  our  system,  use  of  TTM  
significantly  decreased  over  the  study  period.  The

period may be related to several factors. The regional 
system of cardiac care in Los Angeles County is well 
established  and  has  been  in  place  for  over  10  years.  
Coordinated  efforts  by  EMS  leadership  provide  sys-
temwide  policies,  which  are  continually  reviewed  and  
updated,  and  provide  evidence-based  guidelines  on  
appropriate use. Bi-annual meetings are held to review 
data  and  share  best  practices  for  post-resuscitation  
care and include particular emphasis on TTM.
To  our  knowledge,  only  one  prior  study  spe-
cifically  evaluated  use  of  in-hospital  TTM  within  
a  regional  system  of  care  in  the  United  States.

Mooney et al reported on 104 patients treated at the 
Minnesota  Heart  Institute  with  a  newly  established  
TTM  protocol  in  2011.  Given  that  this  protocol  was  
newly established, all 104 patients described in the 
study  received  TTM.  Our  current  analysis  comple-
ments this initial description by the Minnesota Heart 
Institute. The ability to integrate a TTM protocol into 
an  existing  system  of  care  for  patients  with  OHCA  
has implications for more widespread use through-
out  the  United  States.  The  ability  to  mandate  TTM  
use  in  these  established  systems  of  care  would  be  
expected to increase TTM use and also reduce hos-
pital variation. As noted, prior studies suggest large 
variations in TTM use throughout hospitals within the 
United States.

There are several limitations to the present analysis. 
We included all patients with OHCA and ROSC and ex-
cluded only patients who were either awake and alert 
in  the  ED  and  those  that  died  in  the  ED.  We  chose  
this approach to be inclusive of all patients being con-
sidered for TTM, since the registry data, including ra-
tionale for withholding TTM, was abstracted from the 
chart  subsequent  to  that  decision.  Differences  in  the  
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  of  the  current  study  
compared with prior studies may explain some of the 
variation  in  TTM  use.  The  current  study  includes  pa-
tients treated within a single regional care system that 
has been operational for >10 years. The applicability of 
these  results  to  other  regional  care  systems  with  dif-
ferent  treatment  protocols  remains  unclear.  Although  
all  patients  were  evaluated  for  TTM,  the  specific  ap-
proach to cooling was not standardized and included 
various  devices  and  approaches.  This  variability  may  
have influenced the ability to proceed with TTM. Given 
the retrospective nature of data collection, the current 
analysis was limited to the variables present within the 
Figure 2. Characteristics associated with use of targeted temperature management.

data registry. Although missing data were minimal for 
the majority of variables within the data registry, ≈15% 
of  the  cohort  did  not  have  data  extracted  for  race.  
Further,  causality  cannot  be  determined  and,  there-
fore,  evaluation  of  factors  associated  with  TTM  use  
and the association of TTM with clinical and neurologic 
outcome remain exploratory.
CONCLUSIONS
Within a large regional system of care in Los Angeles 
County, use of TTM was substantially higher than pre-
viously reported in the literature at just over 50%. Use 
of integrated systems of care may be a novel method 
to increase TTM use within the United States.
