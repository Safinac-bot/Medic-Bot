AUTHORITY: Health & Safety Code, Division 5, Sections 1797.220, 1798 
 California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 5 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Alcohol Intoxication: A patient who appears to be impaired from alcohol, demonstrated by 
diminished physical and mental control with evidence of recent alcohol consumption (e.g., 
alcohol on breath, presence of alcoholic beverage container(s)) and without other acute 
medical or traumatic cause. Alcohol intoxication is typically associated with one of more of the 
following: 
 
• Speech disturbance – incoherent, rambling, slurring 
• Decline in cognitive function – confusion, inappropriate behavior, impaired 
decision-making capacity 
• Imbalance – unsteady on feet, staggering, swaying 
• Poor coordination – impaired motor function, inability to walk a straight line, 
fumbling for objects  
 
Emergency Medical Condition: A condition or situation in which an individual has an 
immediate need for medical attention. The presence of abnormal vital signs (heart rate and 
rhythm, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation – except isolated asymptomatic 
hypertension) are also indications of an emergency medical condition. Patients who meet any 
criteria for Base Contact or Receiving Hospital Notification (Ref. No. 1200.2) are also 
considered to have an emergency medical condition. 
 
Sobering Center (SC): A non-correctional facility designated by a city or county to provide a 
safe, supportive environment for intoxicated individuals to become sober. A SC shall be 
approved by the EMS Agency by meeting the requirements in this Standards. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. EMS provider agencies must be approved by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
Agency to triage patients with alcohol intoxication to a designated SC. 
 
2. Paramedics who have completed an 8-hour education session regarding the triage of 
patients to a SC are the only EMS personnel authorize to utilize this policy. 
 
3. Patients exhibit alcohol intoxication who meet SC inclusion criteria may also be released 
at scene to local law enforcement agency. Law enforcement officers are highly

encouraged to transport these patients to a designated SC. Paramedics shall document 
on the EMS Report Form to whom the patient was released. 
 
4. In instances where there is potential for the patient to harm self or others, EMS 
personnel shall consider seeking assistance from law enforcement. 
 
5. Any patient who meets the triage criteria for transport to a SC, but who requests to be 
transported to an emergency department of a general acute care hospital, shall be 
transported to the emergency department of a general acute care hospital.  
 
6. In all cases, the health and well-being of the patient is the overriding consideration in 
determining patient destination. Factors to be considered include severity and stability of 
the patient’s illness or injury; status of the receiving facility; anticipated transport time; 
requests by the patient, family, guardian or physician; and EMS personnel and base 
hospital judgment.
