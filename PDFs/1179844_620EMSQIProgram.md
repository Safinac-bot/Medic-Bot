PURPOSE: To establish a process for the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services 
(EMS) Agency and system participants to evaluate the EMS system to ensure safety 
and continued improvement in prehospital patient care delivery. 
 
AUTHORITY: California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 10 
 Health and Safety Code Division 2.5 
 California Evidence Code, Section 1157.7 
 California Civil Code Part 2.6, Section 56 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Adverse Event:  A preventable or non-preventable unintended event that results or has the potential 
to result in harm to the patient.   
 
Indicator:  A well-defined, objective, measurable, and important aspect of care. Other terms for 
indicators include: key performance indicator, metric and quality indicator or measure.  
 
Important Aspects of Care:  Patient care activities that are of greatest significance to the quality of 
patient care.  These include activities that are high in volume, high risk, and/or problem prone for 
patients and/or healthcare providers.  
 
Near Miss Event:  An incident or unsafe condition with the potential for injury, damage or harm that 
is resolved before reaching the patient. Also referred to as a “close call” or “good catch”. 
 
Periodic Review:  A re-evaluation of a discontinued indicator within a predetermined time frame 
after achievement of threshold to ensure ongoing compliance.  
 
Quality Improvement (QI):  The continuous and systematic analysis of performance in an effort to 
improve it.  
 
System Participant:  For the purposes of this policy, a system participant is any prehospital care 
agency or entity required by law, regulation, agreement, or policy to develop and maintain a QI 
program consistent with state and local requirements.  
 
Threshold:  A pre-established level of performance related to a specific indicator.  
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. An EMS QI program is an essential component of an effective EMS system capable 
of providing quality patient care and achieving system performance goals.   
 
2. Key components of an EMS QI program include:  
a. Personnel 
b. Equipment and Supplies

c. Documentation 
d. Data Collection and Analysis 
e. Clinical Care/Patient Outcome 
f. Skills Maintenance/Competency 
g. Transportation/Facilities  
h. Risk Management 
i. Public Education/Prevention 
 
3. EMS organizations become valuable stakeholders in the State QI program by 
participating in the local EMS Agency QI program. 
 
4. Data sampling may be utilized to measure an indicator or monitor performance.  
However, to obtain meaningful data that are representative of the study population, 
factors such as the population affected, the frequency of the activity, and the severity 
of consequence when thresholds are not met, must all be considered when 
determining the size and population of data samples. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. EMS Agency Responsibilities: 
 
A. Implement a state-approved EMS QI plan consistent with all regulatory requirements. 
 
B. Review QI programs and approve QI plans of local EMS system participants. 
 
C. Maintain a systemwide QI program.  
 
II. System Participant Responsibilities:  
 
A. Implement and maintain a QI program approved by the EMS Agency that reflects the 
organization’s current QI process(es). 
 
B. Demonstrate how EMS QI is integrated within the organization. 
 
C. Designate a representative to attend the relevant EMS Agency QI Committee 
meeting(s). 
 
D. Participate in systemwide QI studies, to include timely submission of requested data 
to the EMS Agency. 
 
E. Provide education, training, or other methods utilized to disseminate information 
specific to findings identified in the QI process. 
 
F. Establish and maintain relationships with stakeholders and, as needed, convene 
meetings to facilitate the QI process. 
 
G. Review the QI plan annually and update as needed.  If there are no revisions, a 
signed copy of the QI plan signature page (signed by the Medical Director) or written 
statement to that effect, along with a copy of the current QI indicators, may be 
submitted in lieu of the entire plan.
