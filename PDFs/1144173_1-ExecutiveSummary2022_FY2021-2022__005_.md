EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES 
 
ANNUAL EMS PLAN UPDATE 
(Fiscal Year 2021-2022) 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.254, requires the Emergency Medical 
Services (EMS) Agency to submit an EMS Plan to the State EMS Authority and follow it with 
annual updates thereafter.  Attached is the Los Angeles County Fiscal Year (FY) 2021-2022 
Annual Update which provides the required information on the status of our system and the 
EMS Agency's progress toward meeting long-range goals. 
 
Communications: 
 
The EMS Agency continues to be an active participant and voting member of the governing 
body of the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS) Board of 
Directors.  LA-RICS’ mission is to provide the finest mission-critical communication system with 
unwavering focus on the needs of the public safety professional.  It is being designed and built 
to serve law enforcement and fire service first responders, along with health service 
professionals throughout Los Angeles County. 
 
With over 80 public safety agencies with approximately 34,000 first-responders and 
encompassing a sprawling terrain of over 4,060 square miles that approximately 10 million 
people call home, the Los Angeles region seeks a modern interoperable public safety 
broadband network that allows multiple agencies to respond to the widest possible variety of 
emergencies.  LA-RICS has transferred operation and ownership of its 700MHz broadband 
network to ATT/First-Net, which is based on 4G/5G wireless data technology.   The network 
would enable computer-aided dispatch, rapid law-enforcement queries, real-time video 
streaming, medical telemetry, patient tracking, geographic information systems services for 
first responders, and many other broadband-specific applications. 
LA-RICS is partnered with AT&T/First-Net, a nationwide first responder network authority to 
ensure coordination with the broadband network on a national level for public safety and first 
responders. 
 
EMS System Data Report: 
 
Efforts to incorporate the STEMI and stroke databases into a combined database with the three 
(3) core EMS Agency databases (EMS, Base Hospital, and Trauma Center) continue.     To 
further enhance reporting and access capability, the EMS Agency continues to explore 
opportunities to improve TEMIS, such as a web-based solution. 
 
Of the ~770,000 EMS responses in the County, 100% of patient care records from public 
EMS providers are collected through an electronic patient care report (ePCR).

Sidewalk CPR: 
 
The EMS Agency Sidewalk CPR is an annual program that traditionally provides in-person 
“hands-only” CPR training throughout Los Angeles County during National CPR & AED 
Awareness Week (June1-7).  The Sidewalk CPR program was suspended in 2020 due to 
COVID-19 and continued through 2022.  
 
The EMS Agency and its partners continued to raise awareness about the importance of 
knowing “hands-o nly” CPR with an instructional hands-only CPR video with techniques for 
reducing COVID transmission https://youtu.be/jHaicno95sk
.  This training video is posted on 
our website and shared with community partners to allow for a broader distribution.  Our goal 
is to continue improving bystander CPR response during the pandemic.  The views can be 
tracked when viewed on YouTube.
