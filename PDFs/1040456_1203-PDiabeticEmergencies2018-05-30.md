SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶ In pediatric patients with hypoglycemia consider causes such as medication error or medication given 
without appropriate oral intake, infection, or toxins. Survey scene and ask family for types of 
medications in the home including those in various forms (e.g., pill, patch, drops, salves, inhaled or 
herbal). Caretakers of pediatric patients should always be encouraged to have patient be transported 
to the hospital for evaluation as hypoglycemia in this population is rare as compared to adults and is 
often caused by serious disease or poisonings.  
   
❷    Use judgment based on the clinical status of the patient to determine whether IO placement for 
dextrose and/or fluid administration prior to hospital arrival is warranted.  For altered patients who 
show signs of shock/poor perfusion and/or extremis with severe HYPERglycemia or HYPOglycemia 
and an IV cannot be obtained, an IO may be placed for fluid resuscitation or treatment with dextrose. 
Refer to MCG 1375.    
 
❸    Pediatric patients with hypoglycemia who are successfully treated with oral glucose or Dextrose 10% 
IV and then their parent wishes to decline transport to the hospital should be discouraged to do so, 
especially if they have abnormal vital signs, fever, are taking long acting hypoglycemic agents 
possible ingestion or poisoning, or if they DO NOT have a history of diabetes mellitus as these 
patients are at high risk for recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.  
 
Long Acting hypoglycemic agents 
• Sulfonylureas: gliclazide, glimepiride, glipizide, gliquidone, glyburide, glyclopyramide,  
• Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), troglitazone 
(Rezulin) 
• Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: acarbose, miglitol, voglibose 
• Meglitinides – nateglinide, repaglinide 
• Combination drugs: glipizide and metformin (Metaglip), glyburide and metformin 
(Glucovance), pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact), pioglitazone and metformin (ACTOplus  
• Met), rosiglitazone and metformin (Avandamet), rosiglitazone and glimepiride (Avandaryl) 
   
❹    Glucagon is effective only if there are sufficient glycogen stores in the liver. Patients with low 
glycogen stores such as young infant, severe malnutrition, cirrhosis, or adrenal insufficiency may not 
respond to glucagon.  
 
❺      Patients with hyperglycemia are at risk for significant volume losses leading to dehydration and 
electrolyte abnormalities. Fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline is recommended until their glucose 
can be lowered with medications. Hyperglycemia can also be associated with trauma, infection, or 
other serious illness. For patients with elevated glucose requiring fluids IV Normal Saline should be 
given – only those patients who show signs of poor perfusion and an IV cannot be obtained would 
have an IO placed for fluid resuscitation.
