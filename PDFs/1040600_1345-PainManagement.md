Medical Control Guideline:  PAIN MANAGEMENT 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. All patients should undergo pain assessment and management, regardless 
of age or ability to communicate in English. 
 
2. Uncontrolled pain has been associated with both short-term and long-term 
adverse outcomes. 
 
3. Measurement of a patient’s pain is subjective; therefore, the patient who is able 
to communicate best determines the presence and severity of their pain. 
 
4. Recording a pain level using a validated pain scale provides health care providers with 
a baseline against which to compare subsequent evaluations of the patient’s pain. 
 
5. Los Angeles County utilizes the “Numeric Pain Intensity”, “Facial Expression”, and 
FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability) pain scales. 
 
6. Pain management includes both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic 
interventions, such as distraction, positioning, and medication administration which 
may be provided concurrently or in an escalating fashion. 
 
7. When choosing a pain management strategy, providers should utilize their clinical 
judgment to select the most appropriate initial therapy.  Treatment may be 
escalated as needed to achieve pain control. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Pain assessment   should be performed on patients of all ages as part of the initial 
patient assessment and should include severity as measured on one of the 3 formal 
pain scales used by Los Angeles County. 
 
2. For verbal patients 8 years of age or older, use the Numeric Pain Intensity scale 
by asking the patient to rate their pain on a 0-10 scale; zero (0) equals no pain 
and ten (10) equals the most severe pain. Document the number selected on the 
EMS Report Form. 
 
3. For patients 4-7 years old, or for patients with limited English proficiency, use the 
Facial Expression pain scale.

4. For children < 4 years of age or for patients who are non-verbal due to baseline 
medical conditions such as cognitive impairment or severe dementia, utilize the 
FLACC Behavioral Tool. The patient should be assessed in each of the 5 categories 
shown in the table below, with the pain severity determined based on the total score on 
a scale of 0-10. 
 
Behavior 
0 1 2

Consolability 
Calm, content,

consoling 
Reassured by 
hugging, talking to, 
distractible 
Difficult to console 
or comfort 
 
5. Reassess the patient’s pain with each assessment of vital signs and after any 
intervention, including patient movement into the ambulance. Document pain 
reassessment on the Patient Care Record. 
 
6. Provide indicated treatment to patients with mild to severe pain as measured on any 0-
10 scale per the table below. Nonpharmacologic methods should be used for all 
patients regardless of pain scale. 
Pain Score Indicated Treatment(s) Considerations 
≥1 
Ice packs 
Distraction 
Positioning for comfort 
Splinting 
For pain scores ≥4, use in 
conjunction with most appropriate 
analgesic(s). 
≥4 Ketorolac 
For pain score ≥7, may use in 
conjunction with opioid or alone if 
opioids are contraindicated.  
Avoid in cardiac chest pain. 
 
≥7 
Fentanyl 
Morphine 
May only administer ONE of these 
medications.   
May administer in conjunction with 
ketorolac. 
Opioids should be administered 
alone for cardiac chest pain.

REVISED: 01-01-25  PAGE 3 OF 5
  
 
7. Consider ketorolac in patients with mild to moderate pain (pain score ≥ 4). Ketorolac 
may also be given in patients with moderate to severe pain (pain score ≥ 7) in 
conjunction with opioids, or when contraindications to other opioids exist (e.g., 
hypotension, respiratory failure, opioid allergy. 
 
Ketorolac Dosing 
Adult Dose 
15mg (1mL) slow IV/IO push, or 
30mg (2mL) IM 
 
Pediatric Dose, only for 4 years of age or older 
0.5mg/kg (15mg/mL) slow IV/IO push/IM, dose per MCG 1309 
(maximum dose 15mg any route) 
 
Contraindications 
Active bleeding 
Active wheezing 
Age <4 years old or >65 years old 
Allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) 
Current anticoagulation therapy 
Current steroid use 
Head or multisystem trauma 
History of upper GI bleeding or peptic ulcer disease 
History of renal disease or kidney transplant 
Known or suspected pregnancy 
Suspected sepsis or septic shock 
 
8. Consider opioid analgesia (Fentanyl or Morphine) for patients with moderate to 
severe pain (pain score ≥7). These analgesics should be considered equivalent 
options, however there are scenarios where one agent is preferred: 
 
Opioids preferred: cardiac chest pain, children under 4 years of age  
 
Fentanyl Dosing 
Adult Dose 
50mcg (1mL) slow IV push or IM/IN, repeat every 5 min prn, maximum 
total dose prior to Base contact 150mcg 
 
Pediatric Dose 
1mcg/kg (50mcg/mL) slow IV push or IM, dose per MCG 1309, or 
1.5mcg/kg (50mg/mL) IN, dose per MCG 1309 
Repeat in 5 min prn x1, maximum 2 total doses prior to Base contact 
 
Contraindications 
History of allergy to fentanyl 
Pregnant patients in labor 
 
Contact Base for up to two additional doses based on continued pain 
assessment. Pediatric dosing based on reference 1309 and is weight 
based.  Adult total maximum dose is 250 mcg all routes.

Morphine Dosing 
Adult Dose 
4mg (1mL) slow IV/IO push or IM, repeat every 5 min prn, maximum 
total dose prior to Base contact 12mg 
 
Pediatric Dose 
0.1mg/kg (4mg/mL) slow IV/IO push or IM, dose per MCG 1309, repeat 
in 5 min x1, maximum 2 total doses prior to Base contact 
 
Contraindications 
Hypotension or evidence or poor perfusion 
History of allergy to morphine 
Pregnant patients in labor 
 
Contact Base for up to two additional doses based on continued pain 
assessment. Pediatric dosing based on reference 1309 and is weight 
based.  Adult total maximum dose is 20 mg all routes. 
 
9. Specific treatment protocols may have pain medication dosing parameters that differ 
from this MCG. In such cases, treatment protocol dosing parameters take 
precedence. 
   
10. Use caution when administering pain medications in the following patient situations: 
 
a. Elderly patients 
b. Adults with SBP <90mmHg; Pediatrics with hypotension relative to size per MCG 
1309 (ketorolac preferred – this agent is less likely to worsen hypotension) 
c. Potential for respiratory failure (ketorolac preferred – this agent is less likely to 
worsen respiratory depression 
d. Suspected drug/alcohol intoxication 
 
11. When giving opioids, consider administering ondansetron 4mg ODT or IV prior to or 
concurrent with administration of first dose in patients 4 years of age or older. These 
medications may cause nausea and vomiting. 
 
12. Location of intramuscular injections are as follows: 
 
a. Pediatric patients 14 years of age or younger use the lateral thigh (vastus 
lateralis) 
b. Adult patients 15 years of age or older use the deltoid or the vastus lateralis 
 
13. Document and report all interventions performed for pain management, whether 
pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic. These may include, but are not limited to: 
 
a. Nonpharmacologic: 
i. Splinting 
ii. Distraction with devices (e.g. video viewing) 
iii. Ice pack application 
iv. Positioning for comfort 
 
b. Pharmacologic: Medication administration

14. Contact Base for orders if patient’s condition requires additional dosing of 
medications beyond that permitted by Treatment Protocol.
