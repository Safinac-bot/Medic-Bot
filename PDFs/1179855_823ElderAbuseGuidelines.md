PURPOSE: To define the required reporting procedures for prehospital care personnel 
regarding known or suspected elder or dependent adult abuse. 
 
AUTHORITY: Welfare and Institutions Code, Division 9, Sections 15600, et seq. 
   
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Abandonment: The desertion or willful forsaking of an elder or dependent adult by anyone 
having care or custody of that person under circumstances in which a reasonable person would 
continue to provide care or custody. 
 
Abuse of an elder or a dependent adult: Physical abuse (including sexual abuse), neglect, 
financial abuse, abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other treatment with resulting physical 
harm or mental suffering, or the deprivation by a care custodian of goods or services that are 
necessary to avoid physical harm or mental suffering. 
 
Dependent Adult: Any person between the ages of 18 and 64 years, who has physical or 
mental limitations that restrict their ability to carry out normal activities or to protect their rights. 
This includes, but is not limited to, persons who have physical or developmental disabilities. It 
also includes individuals whose physical or mental abilities have diminished because of age, as 
well as any 18 to 64 year-old who is admitted as an inpatient to a 24-hour health facility. 
 
Elder: Any person who is 65 years of age or older. 
 
Mandated Reporter: Any person who has assumed full or intermittent responsibility for care or 
custody of an elder or dependent adult, whether or not that person receives compensation, 
including administrators, supervisors, and any licensed staff of a public or private facility that 
provides care or services for elder or dependent adults, or any elder or dependent adult care 
custodian, health practitioner, or employee of a county adult protective services agency, or a 
local law enforcement agency is a mandated reporter. 
 
Neglect:  The negligent failure of any person having care or custody of an elder or dependent 
adult to exercise that degree of care that a reasonable person in a like position would exercise. 
 
Physical abuse: Assault, battery, unreasonable physical constraint, prolonged or continual 
deprivation of food or water, sexual assault or battery or rape (including spousal rape, incest, 
sodomy, oral copulation, or penetration by a foreign object). 
 
Reasonable suspicion: An objectively reasonable suspicion of abuse that a person should 
entertain, based upon the facts, and drawing upon the person’s training and experience. 
 
Self-neglect: Failure of the elder or dependent adult to exercise a reasonable degree of care in 
providing for their own needs in such areas as personal hygiene, food, clothing, and shelter.

  ADULT ABUSE REPORTING GUIDELINES 
 
 
PAGE 2 OF 4 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Elder and dependent adults may be subjected to abuse, neglect, or abandonment. 
 
2. Health care providers are mandated to report known or suspected abuse, neglect or self-
neglect of elder or dependent adults to protect and ensure the safety of these 
individuals. 
 
3. When two or more mandated reporters are present at the scene and jointly have 
knowledge of a known or reasonably suspected instance of elder or dependent adult 
abuse, the telephone report can be made by a selected member of the reporting team. 
Any member who has knowledge that the designated reporter failed to uphold their 
agreement shall thereafter make the report. Transfer of care to the hospital does not 
meet the reporting obligation. 
 
4. Reports made under this law are confidential. The identity of persons making reports of 
elder or dependent adult abuse is also confidential. This information is shared between 
the investigating and licensing agencies. This information will be shared with the district 
attorney in a criminal prosecution resulting from the report, by court order, or when the 
reporter waives confidentiality. 
 
5. Reporting is the individual responsibility of the mandated reporter. No supervisor or 
administrator may prohibit the filing of the required report. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. EMTs, Paramedics, and Mobile Intensive Care Nurses (MICNs) are mandated reporters 
and shall file a telephone and written report whenever, in their professional capacity or 
within the scope of their employment, the following occurs: 
 
A. The reporter has observed or has knowledge of an incident or injury that 
reasonably appears to be the result of abuse, neglect, or self-neglect; or 
 
B. The reporter is told by an elder or a dependent adult that he or she has 
experienced behavior constituting abuse, neglect, or self-neglect; or 
 
C. The reporter reasonably suspects abuse, neglect, or self-neglect. 
 
II. Mandated reporters have immunity from civil and criminal liability for making a good faith 
report of a known or suspected elder or dependent adult abuse. This immunity includes 
taking photographs of the victim to submit with the report.] 
 
III. Failure to report abuse, neglect, or self-neglect of an elder or dependent adult is a 
misdemeanor, punishable by not more than six months in the county jail or by a fine of 
$1,000 or both. A mandated reporter who willfully fails to report abuse, neglect, or self-
abuse of an elder or dependent adult, where that abuse results in death or great bodily 
injury, is punishable by not more than one year in the county jail or by a fine of not more 
than $5,000 or both.
