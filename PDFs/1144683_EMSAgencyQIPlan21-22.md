I.  Introduction 
 
 
Los Angeles County EMS Agency Mission Statement 
 
 
 
 
The Los Angeles County (LAC) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency is 
responsible for monitoring and implementing regulatory oversight over for one of the 
largest multijurisdictional EMS systems in the nation. The LAC system utilizes more 
than 18,000 certified EMS personnel employed by public and private organizations, 
fire departments, ambulance companies, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies to 
provide emergency and non-emergency prehospital care to over 10 million residents 
and visitors. 
 
LAC requires a comprehensive quality improvement (QI) program to provide ongoing 
system evaluation to maintain quality in day-to-day operations while implementing 
process improvement strategies to advance patient care delivery that are consistent 
with best practices and evidence-based medicine. The QI plan provides the written 
framework for the QI program. 
 
Our system utilizes a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to drive improvement. 
It is educational, not punitive by design to encourage the exchange of information to 
enhance patient safety and minimize adverse events. Quality patient care delivery is 
sustained through ongoing evaluation, timely system feedback and education, in 
addition to, providing opportunities to acknowledge performance excellence within 
the system. 
 
The EMS Agency and QI program supports the California EMS Authority (EMSA) in 
the development, implementation, and reporting of statewide core measures. 
 
The LAC EMS QI plan is written in accordance with the California Code of Regulations, 
Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 12: Emergency Medical Services System Quality 
Improvement and is consistent with the State of California Emergency Medical 
Services System Quality Improvement Program Model Guidelines and EMSA 166, 
Appendix E, EMS Core Quality Measures.

III. Data Management 
A. Data Collection 
The EMS Agency obtains information through a variety of methods that include 
the following: electronic data exchange, hard copy review, internal and  external 
customer surveys, and program reviews (audits). Data collection is primarily 
conducted via the Trauma and Emergency Medicine Information System 
(TEMIS), Lancet Technology Innovative Data Solutions by ESO. The TEMIS 
database assists the EMS Agency in evaluating, monitoring, and coordinating 
all EMS system components, as well as meet state data collection 
requirements. 
All public 9-1-1 and Exclusive Operating Area provider agencies utilize an 
electronic patient care record (ePCR) platform. Paramedic base hospitals and 
trauma centers utilizing paper PCR capture the required data elements using 
an approved electronic platform and standard paper forms (EMS Report Form, 
Base Hospital Form and Trauma Patient Summary Form). All paramedic base 
hospitals and trauma centers conduct data entry on site. The data is uploaded 
automatically to a dedicated File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site every 24 hours. 
Many of the private (non-911) private provider agencies have transitioned 
from paper to an ePCR with the remainder utilizing paper PCR.  
Other mechanisms by which the EMS Agency obtains data include direct data 
input to the LA STEMI and LA Stroke databases by the designated SRC and 
stroke hospitals. Stroke data is also downloaded from the Get With The 
Guidelines (GWTG) Patient Management Tool. Helicopter EMS (HEMS) data is 
submitted to the EMS Agency on a quarterly basis from the three HEMS 
providers in LA County. The EMS Agency continues to work on the process of 
incorporating the STEMI, Stroke and HEMS data into TEMIS. Systemwide data 
collection on hospital diversion, bed availability, and surge capacity are 
collected via ReddiNet.

The Public Safety Agency Data Registry allows public safety agencies approved 
for naloxone administration to enter data directly into the data registry. Each 
public safety agency may utilize the data registry to generate reports on their 
own agency to assist in the quality improvement process required 
for program approval. The EMS Agency oversees the data and is 
able to provide aggregate system reports. 
 
B. Data Validation 
Data submitted to the EMS Agency databases undergoes an extensive data 
quality review and clean up through the following mechanisms: 
 
1.  EMS provider agencies utilizing electronic data collection are required to 
validate their data using the EMS Agency’s published EMS Data 
Validator before submission to the FTP site. The EMS Agency conducts 
a secondary validation before final upload to TEMIS. Data that fails 
validation is rejected and sent back to the EMS Provider for correction. 
 
2.  Annual data audits are conducted by the EMS Agency for each EMS 
Provider Agency. A corrective action plan is required for data elements 
that fall below a 90% compliance rate for accuracy and completeness. 
 
3.  Data clean up reports are generated by the EMS Agency on a quarterly 
basis for Paramedic Base Hospitals and Trauma Centers. In general, a 
corrective action plan is required for data elements that fall below a 90% 
compliance rate for accuracy and completeness. 
 
4.  Documentation reports are routinely developed and disseminated in the 
quality improvement committees for evaluation and education on the 
application of the data dictionary and data standards to improve 
reliability. 
C. Data Submission 
1.  The EMS Agency ensures timely data collection and submission from 
base and trauma hospitals through written agreements. 
2.  Data collection requirements for other specialty care centers are 
prescribed in the specific specialty care center Standards and local 
policies. 
 
3.  EMS provider agency data collection requirements are governed by local 
policies. Submission of required data to the EMS Agency is highly 
dependent upon organizational resources (method of data collection/ 
ePCR vendor) and size (personnel/volume of EMS responses). The EMS 
Agency has established policies and procedures specific to submission of 
ePCR data. However, provider agencies can experience vendor-related 
problems that can cause significant delays in data submission. The EMS 
Agency and EMS community continue to work together on improving 

Los Angeles County

data collection and submission as the system  transitions to the CEMSIS 
data requirements. 
4.  The LA County Trauma Center Programs participate in the American 
College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) and 
are members of the LA County TQIP Collaborative. Collaborative system- 
level TQIP reports allow us to compare our system performance to 
national results and impart opportunities for systemwide QI projects. 
5.  EMS providers may be required to submit self-reported data utilizing 
Excel spreadsheets for the following reasons: 
a.  Non-911 (interfacility) transports are not entered into TEMIS. 
 
b.  Base hospitals and public 911 provider agencies may be required 
to submit self-reported data on prospective QI projects when the 
required  data cannot  be accessed  through  the  EMS  Agency 
databases. 
 
c.   Provider agencies approved for pilot projects utilizing an 
expanded  local optional scope of practice requiring data 
submission not captured in the EMS Agency databases. 
 
d.  The EMS Agency began systemwide participation in    the Cardiac 
Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) in January 2021. 
The EMS Agency enters the required data for the system with the 
exception of 3 provider agencies who directly enter their data into 
CARES.  
 
D. Data Utilization 
1.  The EMS Agency utilizes the TEMIS, LA STEMI, LA Stroke, and GWTG 
databases for both statewide core measures and local system reports. 
The local reports are utilized for daily operations such as performance 
and contract monitoring, system audits, policy revision, and QI activities. 
The databases are also used to provide the information needed to 
analyze the potential impact of hospital diversions and closures. 
2.  Self-reported data utilizing Excel spreadsheets  for private non-9-1-1 
provider agency and when needed, 9-1-1 provider agency QI activities 
aimed at evaluating performance and ensuring safety when 
implementing new medications, treatment and/or devices into the 
system. 
 
3.   The Public Safety Data Registry was implemented in May 2020 to allow 
for public safety agencies with approved naloxone programs to    enter 
their data. Each agency can only view and download reports on their 
data. The EMS Agency anticipates expanding the registry in the future 
to collect additional data regarding other field care provided by public 
safety personnel (i.e., tourniquet application and AED).

E. Limitations 
1.  Separate Databases: The existence of multiple databases is not 
ideal for timely reporting. Multiple data entry and data abstraction are 
conducted on the same patient. Data analysis is resource-intensive 
when data elements are found in the various databases. 
2.  Multiple System Participants: Data validation and transmission is 
complex due to multiple electronic PCR software applications. 
Changes to the reporting standards often require additional time and 
expense. 
3.  Data Quality: Current methods of data capture require extensive data 
audits. Cleanup is needed to ensure valid and reliable data. 
 
IV. Quality Measures 
A. Utilization of Provider Impression/Treatment Protocols 
The EMS Public 9-1-1 Provider Agency and Base Hospital QI Committee assisted 
the EMS Agency in systemwide evaluation if the high-risk Treatment Protocols (TP) 
and Provider Impressions (PI)  from 2020 through 2022 utilizing Reference No. 
1375 as the standard for determining fallouts. The TPs and PIs will continue to be 
evaluated as part of the QI process using a combination of the EMS Agency 
databases and self-reported data to ensure appropriate utilization. Link to 
Reference No. 1375, MCG: Treatment Protocol QI Fallout Data Dictionary: 
file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1040527_1373-TPQIFalloutDataDictionary.pdf
 
 
B. Ambulance Patient Offload Time (APOT) 
The EMS Agency continues to work with the system participants to collect data 
using the standardize methods for collecting and reporting APOT data adopted by 
the EMS Authority. The APOT workgroup met quarterly to assist the EMS Agency 
in policy development to reduce 9-1-1 patient offload time. M embers include 
representatives from the following organizations: Hospital Association of Southern 
California, Los Angeles County Ambulance Association, Emergency Nurses 
Association, Los Angeles County Professional Fire Fighter’s union, public (9-1-1) 
and private (non-911) provider agencies, and base hospitals. Additionally, the non-
911 provider agencies collect and submit APOT data to the EMS Agency on 
interfacility (non-911) transports to    the emergency department and in-patient 
hospital in an effort to track and improve time to transfer of care.   
 
C. EMSA Core Quality Measures 
The EMS Agency historically has participated in statewide data submission to 
CEMSIS and continues to actively participate in statewide data collection through 
the submission of core measure data outlined in EMSA #166 – Appendix E. To 
ensure reliable and valid data, the EMS Agency updates the data dictionary and 
provide training/feedback to EMS personnel on documentation of the core measure

data elements with the exception of ambulance response times by zones. The LAC 
EMS system is not designed to collect data by zones. Alternatively, systemwide 
ambulance response times are collected and reported. Data is    available upon 
request. 
 
D. Pediatric Readiness Project –    LA Peds Ready 
The National Pediatric Readiness Project
 (NPRP) is    a multi-phase quality improvement 
initiative to ensure all emergency departments have the essential resources in place to 
provide effective emergency care to sick and injured children. The NPRP is partnership 
with the federal EMS for Children program, American Academy of Pediatrics,  American 
College of Emergency Physicians, and Emergency Nurses Association. 
lapedsready.org was developed to assist the Los Angeles County emergency 
departments with access to the NPRP assessment tools, resources, and on-line 
educational activities designed to improve the delivery of pediatric emergency care in 
our system. Participation in the NPRP assessment has been added to the Los Angeles 
County EDAP standards.  
 
E. COVID-19 
Early 2020 the EMS Agency implemented Reference No.1245, Potential COVID-19 
Patients and Reference No. 845, Treat and Refer for Mild Respiratory Illness 
during the COVID-19 outbreak to guide treatment and transport decisions during 
the emerging pandemic. This required a change in our system performance 
indicators to evaluate the delivery of care for potential COVID-19 patients. A 
dedicated webpage was established to facilitate timely access to current 
information on COVID-19 related hospital and prehospital data, PPE distribution, 
and educational resources. Additionally, the EMS Agency implemented weekly 
Zoom conference calls led by the Medical Director to provide the EMS community 
with updated information on clinical and operational processes that impact the 
delivery        of prehospital care. In 2021 as the rate of hospitalizations and critical 
illness declined, the weekly calls moved to ad hoc based on COVID surges and 
community needs. Link to COVID-19 Resources and Updates:

V.   Prehospital Research 
Research provides an evidence base to support prehospital medical treatments and 
interventions. The EMS Agency actively supports prehospital research through the 
Research Data Collaboratives.    Link to EMS System Publications: 
dhs.lacounty.gov/emergency-medical-services-agency/home/resources-ems/ems-
system-publications/ 
 
VI. Evaluation of System Indicators 
A. The System EMS QI Coordinator and designated staff prepare reports on 
system performance indicators to be utilized by the QI Team, advisory 
committees (Medical Advisory Council, Base Hospital Advisory, and 
Provider Agency Advisory) and specialty care committees (STEMI, 
stroke, trauma, pediatric) to ensure systemwide evaluation. 
 
B. Under the direction of the EMS Agency Medical Director, the EMS Agency QI 
Team will analyze system reports generated by each EMS Agency section 
responsible for collecting and reporting on current performance indicators, 
including the EMSA Core Measures.  
 
C. Presentations on performance indicators will be prepared in the most 
appropriate format to allow for ease of interpretation of data. Formats most 
commonly utilized include line charts, bar graphs, flowcharts, and data tables. 
 
VII. Action to Improve 
 
A.   The EMS Agency, under the direction of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, utilizes the FOCUS PDSA model for performance improvement. 
 
1. Find a    process to improve; improvement needs are identified by the EMS 
Agency QI Team in collaboration with the TAG, QI and Advisory groups. 
2. Organize the process utilizing the team most familiar with the process related to 
the system process identified. 
3. Clarify current knowledge of the process by collecting information and reviewing 
current trends.

4. Understand capabilities and causes for variations in processes by utilizing 
brainstorming techniques and fishbone diagrams or flowcharts. 
5. Select a strategy or process for improvement that will most likely reduce or 
eliminate the causes for variation in performance. 
6. Plan, determine objectives and develop plan in agreement with system 
participants. 
7. Do, carry out the action according to established plan. 
8. Study findings, the EMS QI Team with system input will analyze the findings, 
compare with hypothesis, and prepare a summary for a trend report. 
9. Act on findings, the EMS QI Team in collaboration with the TAG, QI and 
Advisory groups will determine performance improvement needs. A Quality 
Task Force may be chartered if needed, to carry out specific performance 
improvement plans. 
 
VIII. Training and Education 
 
A. The effectiveness of the QI process is related to the efficacy of training and 
educational activities. Due the size and complexity of our system, training and 
education is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms: 
1. Quality Improvement Committees/Advisory Meetings 
Information needed for improving local system and statewide 
performance is disseminated to committee members for training and 
education of providers responsible for direct patient care.
 
 
2. EMS Update 
Under the direction of Dr. Denise Whitfield, the EMS Agency staff, 
Paramedic Training Institute, and system stakeholders develop and 
implement the mandatory annual EMS Update that address educational 
and training needs related to performance improvement. The format was 
changed to an on-line training utilizing a learning management system 
2020. 
3. EMS Data Report 
The EMS Agency publishes an annual data report that provides valuable 
feedback to the EMS community and citizens of Los Angeles on system 
demographics and performance
.  
 
 
4.  
The Emergi-Press is a web-based EMS educational forum located on the 
EMS Agency website as well as an educational program for providers 
and stakeholders to integrate into their learning management systems 
with the ability for EMS personnel to earn continuing education credit. 
Educational material includes, ECG of the month video learning modules, 
and cases from the field and is developed quarterly. Additionally, the 
Emergi-Press utilizes Updates from the Medical Director to communicate 
pertinent information regarding system issues. Link to present and past 
EmergiPress:

B. The EMS Agency QI Team and other advisory groups review policies and 
procedures to e nsure consistency with the EMSA and LAC EMS QI plan. 
C. Once a performance improvement plan has been successfully implemented, the 
EMS Agency will post all policies and system updates to its website to allow 
timely access by all EMS participants. 
VIII. Update/Summary 
The QI plan was updated to reflect the changes in our plan and performance 
measures.  CY 2020-  2021 required the EMS Agency to focus efforts on evaluating 
COVID-19 related Provider Impressions, utilization of Treatment Protocol Reference 
No. 1245, Potential COVID-19 Patient  (updated in 2022), Reference No.834, Patient 
Refusal of Treatment or Transport,  and Reference No. 845, Treat and Refer for Mild 
Respiratory Illness During the COVID-19 Outbreak. A multidisciplinary task force was 
convened in 2022 to review and revise Reference No. 834 guidelines to assist EMS 
personnel in determining who can be safely released on scene, in addition to, 
identifying high-risk patients who require transport. The QI plan is submitted to EMSA 
for review and published on the EMS Agency website for review by the EMS 
participants and system stakeholders.

 evaluate all at the same time. A QI 
sub-committee was convened in 
December  2019 to develop a new 
strategy for evaluating the new high-
risk TPs. One quarter of 2020 data was 
collected. Due to the pandemic, March 
2020, the metrics were changed to 
evaluating the PIs of concern and 
utilization of TP, 1245, Potential 
COVID-19 Patients. Excel
