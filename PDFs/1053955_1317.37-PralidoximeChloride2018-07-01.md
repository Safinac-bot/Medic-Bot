Mechanism of Action 
Reactivates cholinesterase by displacing the enzyme from its receptor sites. The free enzyme then can 
resume its function of degrading accumulated acetylcholine, thereby restoring normal neuromuscular 
transmission. Pralidoxime also detoxifies some organophosphates by direct chemical reaction. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is 2-3 min; peak effect in 5-15 min; duration is 2-3 hr 
 
Contraindications 
Poisonings with carbamate insecticide Sevin, inorganic phosphates, organophosphates with no 
anticholinesterase
