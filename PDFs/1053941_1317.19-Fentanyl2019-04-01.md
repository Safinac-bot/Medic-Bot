None 
 
Adult Dose 
50mcg (1mL) slow IV/IO push or IM/IN, repeat every 5 min prn, maximum total dose prior to Base contact 
150mcg

Contact Base for additional pain management after maximum dose administered: may repeat dose for a 
maximum 4 total doses 
 
Mechanism of Action 
Narcotic agonist-analgesic of opiate receptors; inhibits ascending pain pathways thus altering response to 
pain, increases pain threshold, produces analgesia, respiratory depression and sedation 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is immediate; peak in 3-5 min; duration is 30-60 min 
 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity 
Pregnant patients in labor 
 
Interactions 
Alcohol and other central nervous system depressants potentiate its effect 
 
Adverse Effects 
Chest wall stiffness / Chest wall pain 
Delirium / Convulsions (uncommon) 
Muscle stiffness 
Nausea and vomiting (most common) 
Respiratory depression 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Monitor respiratory status. Respiratory depression, when it occurs, may last longer than the analgesic 
effect. 
• Administer slowly to decrease likelihood of chest stiffness, which can be life threatening. 
• Onset of fentanyl is quicker, and duration of action is shorter as compared to morphine. Unlike 
morphine, fentanyl does not cause histamine release. Therefore, it is unlikely to cause hypotension in 
therapeutic dosages. 
• Naloxone can be used for reversal if needed.
