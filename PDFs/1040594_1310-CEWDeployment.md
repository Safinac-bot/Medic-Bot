PRINCIPLE:

electrical weapon (CEW), trade name Taser
®
. Law enforcement should secure 
the scene and ensure the safety of EMS personnel before the patient is 
assessed or treated.

head trauma, alcohol or drug related problems, metabolic disorders, stress or 
psychiatric problems. 
 
3. Concurrent intoxication with cocaine, methamphetamine, phencyclidine (PCP), or 
other stimulants is common among those subdued by law enforcement with 
electrical weapons. 
 
4. Physical assessment should include evaluation for any potential injury that may 
have occurred as a result of the use of a CEW. 
 
5. Paramedics cannot medically clear CEW patients for booking by law enforcement. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Do not remove CEW barbs, probes or darts unless they interfere with the 
patient’s airway, for life-saving measures, or the individual cannot be safely 
transported with the barbs in place. 
 
2. Complete a thorough physical assessment for all patients who have sustained the 
use of a CEW. 
 
3. Maintain a high index of suspicion for traumatic injuries (i.e., sustained from 
fall) as a result of the deployment and discharge of the CEW. 
 
4. Paramedics shall make Base Hospital Contact and transport in accordance 
with the protocol appropriate for the Provider Impression.  For isolated CEW
