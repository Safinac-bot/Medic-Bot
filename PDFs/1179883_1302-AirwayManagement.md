Medical Control Guideline: AIRWAY MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Advanced Airway Maneuvers: Use of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ET) or supraglottic airway 
(SGA), e.g., i-gel, to facilitate ventilation and/or oxygenation in a patient who is unable to protect 
his/her own airway or maintain spontaneous ventilation. 
 
Attempt Advanced Airway Placement: Insertion of the laryngoscope into the mouth for the 
purposes of intubation (for endotracheal intubation (ETI)); insertion of the SGA into the mouth. 
 
Basic Airway Maneuvers: Manual airway positioning, obstructed airway maneuvers, bag-
mask-ventilation (BMV), and/or use of airway adjuncts (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal 
airways) to provide ventilation and/or to facilitate oxygenation in a patient who is unable to 
maintain adequate spontaneous ventilation. 
 
Emerging Infectious Disease (EID): Infectious diseases that have newly appeared in a 
population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range, or that 
are caused by one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category 
A, B, or C priority pathogens. 
 
Hypoxia: Lower than normal oxygen (O
2
) concentration in the blood resulting in diminished 
availability of O
2
 to the body tissues. 
 
Hyperoxia: Exposure of cells, tissues and organs to an excess supply of oxygen. 
 
Hypoventilation: Ventilation that is inadequate to support gas exchange in the lung.  
 
Manageable Airway: Ventilation is effective, such that one of the following holds true: 
a. Patient is breathing adequately through a patent airway. 
b. Patient is mechanically ventilated effectively via bag-mask-ventilation (BMV), 
SGA or ET. 
 
Unmanageable Airway: The patient is not able to breathe adequately, and EMS personnel are 
not able to maintain the patient’s airway and/or cannot ventilate the patient effectively via BMV, 
SGA or ET. 
 
Secure Airway: The patient’s trachea is isolated from the risk of aspiration via a cuffed ET in 
the trachea.   
 
Successful Advanced Airway Placement:  Placement of the device such that the patient can 
be ventilated with minimal or no air leak, confirmed primarily with end-tidal CO
2
 measurement 
with capnography.  Secondary confirmation methods include visible chest rise during ventilation 
and air movement on pulmonary auscultation. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Signs and symptoms of hypoxia may include O
2
 saturation (SpO
2
) < 94% with respiratory 
distress, altered mental status or changes in skin signs.

2. Providing O
2
 to emergency medical services (EMS) patients may be a lifesaving 
procedure. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia are potentially harmful; therefore, O
2
 should be 
treated like any other drug and administered when indicated. 
 
3. Hypoventilation results in high arterial carbon dioxide (CO
2
).  In general, this results in an 
end-tidal CO
2
 > 45mmHg on capnography, but end-tidal CO
2 
may not reflect arterial CO
2
 
when lung disease and/or increased dead space are present. 
 
4. Basic airway maneuvers should be performed prior to advanced airway maneuvers on 
patients with hypoventilation. 
 
5. Techniques and procedures utilized for airway management may vary based on 
operational environment, patient condition and the EMS personnel’s level of training and 
expertise. 
 
6. Patients with unmanageable airway shall be transported to the most accessible receiving 
facility. 
 
7. In Los Angeles County, endotracheal intubation (ETI) and the supraglottic airway (SGA) 
i-gel are approved advanced airway options. 
 
8. ETI provides a secure airway. SGAs may not protect the patient from aspiration. 
However, the device is easier to place than an ET and can provide effective ventilations 
to most patients in need of an advanced airway. 
 
9. SGA placement is recommended when a patient’s medical condition or anatomy predicts 
likely failure of ETI and in situations where prehospital personnel attempt but are unable 
to successfully perform ETI.  If ventilation via SGA is effective, it should not be removed 
and replaced with an ET. 
 
10. SGA is the preferred advanced airway for patients experiencing cardiac arrest.  
 
11. Advanced airway placement must be verified and continually monitored.  
 
12. Pulse oximetry and capnography are essential tools for monitoring the effectiveness of 
airway management. While pulse oximetry monitors oxygenation, it does not assess 
adequacy of ventilation. Capnography is necessary to monitor ventilation. Capnography 
is most accurate with proper two-person BMV technique or advanced airway. 
 
13. Hyperventilation (end-tidal CO
2
 <30 mmHg), by rate or volume or both, should be 
avoided.  
 
a. Hyperventilation, when applied inappropriately, increases intrathoracic pressure 
reducing venous return and cardiac output, and is particularly harmful in low-flow 
states including cardiac arrest. It results in low arterial carbon dioxide (CO
2
), 
which is harmful in multiple conditions, such as mild or moderate traumatic brain 
injury. Further, it can cause pulmonary injury including barotrauma and increased 
incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
 
14. Under rare circumstances, targeted mild hyperventilation (end-tidal CO
2
 30-35 mmHG) 
may be indicated for comatose patients with signs of severe traumatic brain injury and 
impending herniation or to match a patient’s physiology in cases of severe metabolic 
acidosis.

GUIDELINES: 
 
1. If pulse oximetry is not available (BLS Unit) and the patient is in mild or moderate 
respiratory distress, provide O
2
 with nasal cannula at 2-6 liters per minute. 
 
2. When available, use pulse oximetry to guide oxygen therapy.  The desired SpO
2
 for 
most non-critical patients is 94-98%. Document pulse oximetry reading. 
 
3. Initiate immediate high-flow O
2
 (15 L/min) for the following conditions: 
a. Respiratory Arrest (impending or actual) 
b. Cardiac Arrest 
c. Shock/Poor Perfusion (including anaphylactic shock) 
d. Traumatic Brain Injury 
e. Carbon Monoxide Exposure 
f. Suspected Pneumothorax 
g. Hypoxia <94% not corrected with nasal cannula or simple mask 
 
 
4. If high-flow O
2
 is indicated, use one of the following O
2
 delivery system based on the 
patient’s condition: 
a. Non-rebreather mask (NRB) 
b. BMV with reservoir  
c. Endotracheal tube (ET) 
d. Supraglottic airway (SGA) 
e. CPAP per MCG 1315 
 
5. For stable patients with mild hypoxia (SpO
2
 less than 94%), start O
2 
with nasal cannula 
at 2-6 L/min or simple mask at 8-10 L/min if available.  If patient is unable to tolerate 
nasal cannula or mask, use blow-by technique with O
2
 flowing at 15 L/min.  
 
6. Consider the following special populations when titrating oxygen therapy: 
a. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) – goal SpO
2
 is 88 – 92% 
b. Newborns in need of positive-pressure ventilation – ventilate for 90 seconds with 
room air, if heart rate remains less than 100 beats per minute, start O
2
 at 15 L/min 
c. Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease – use O
2
 with caution if known history of low 
baseline O
2
 saturation 
 
7. Continue to monitor SpO
2
 and titrate O
2
 therapy as appropriate for the patient’s clinical 
condition until transfer of patient care. 
 
8. Document the SpO
2
,
 
O
2
 delivery system used, and the liters per minute administered. 
 
9. If suctioning is required, pre-oxygenate (as applicable) prior to suctioning and do not 
suction longer than 10 seconds per occurrence. For tracheal suctioning, maintain sterile 
procedures.   
 
10. Considerations for oropharyngeal airway: 
a. Unresponsive patient requiring BMV – should be utilized in all such patients where 
gag reflex is absent

REVISED: 04-01-25 PAGE 4 OF 6 
b. In pediatric patients, placement may not be necessary to achieve adequate 
ventilation 
 
11. Considerations for nasopharyngeal airway: 
a. Spontaneously breathing patients who require assistance in maintaining a patent 
airway (e.g., seizure patient, intoxication) 
b. Unresponsive patients requiring BMV in whom an oropharyngeal airway cannot be 
inserted 
 
12. Considerations for BMV: 
a. Apnea or agonal respirations 
b. Altered level of consciousness with hypoventilation or hypoxia despite maximal 
supplemental O
2
 
 
13. Considerations for ETI: 
Adults or Pediatrics 12 years or greater, or longer than the length-based resuscitation 
tape (e.g., Broselow Tape™) 
a. Ineffective ventilation with BMV 
b. Prolonged transport time 
c. Risk for aspiration 
d. Other determined need for advanced airway and SGA contraindicated 
 
14. Considerations for SGA i-gel: 
a. Adult and pediatric patients experiencing respiratory and/or cardiac arrest with 
ineffective BMV 
b. Adult and pediatric patients experiencing respiratory arrest after initial BMV 
c. Adult and pediatric patients experiencing cardiac arrest after initial priorities of the 
resuscitation are met including: 
o Shockable rhythms: defibrillation x2 
o Nonshockable rhythms: epinephrine x1 and reversible causes addressed prn 
o Traumatic arrest: hemorrhage control and transport initiated 
d. Adult and pediatric patients after return of spontaneous circulation 
e. Need for advanced airway and suspected difficult ETI based on assessment and 
anatomical features 
f. Unsuccessful attempts (maximum three attempts) at ETI (with or without the use of a 
flexible introducer guide) 
 
15. i-gel size is based on patients ideal body weight (MCG 1309).  Patients in between sizes 
may require changing sizes if the initial selection results in leak.  Initial size should be 
based on the table below. 
 
i-gel size selection 
Patient Weight Patient Size i-gel Size 
2-5 kg Neonate 1 
5-12 kg Infant 1.5 
10-25 kg Small Pediatric 2 
25-35 kg Large Pediatric 2.5 
30-60 kg Small Adult (short <5ft) 3 

SUBJECT:  AIRWAY MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING REFERENCE NO. 1302 
 
REVISED: 04-01-25 PAGE 5 OF 6 
50-90 kg Medium Adult (average 5-6ft) 4 
90+ kg Large Adult (tall >6ft) 5 
 
16. Considerations for stoma intubation: 
a. Adult patients with tracheostomy obstruction unrelieved by suctioning and replacing 
inner cannula. 
b. Adult patients with respiratory failure with an uncuffed tracheostomy tube. 
c. For pediatric patients, and for adult patients in which a new tube cannot be placed, 
perform bag mask ventilation via mouth (while covering the stoma) or stoma (if no 
chest rise with mask over mouth). 
 
17. Verify endotracheal tube or SGA placement utilizing capnography.  In case of device 
failure use an End-tidal CO
2
 detector. Document the method used for placement 
verification. 
 
18. Additional confirmation of endotracheal tube placement shall include all of the following: 
a. Bilateral lung sounds 
b. Bilateral chest rise 
c. Absent gastric sounds 
d. Pulse oximetry 
 
19. Continuously assess ventilation status and monitor capnography for all patients requiring 
BMV or advanced airway placement. Report capnography reading to the base hospital 
and document capnography reading as follows: 
a. Every five minutes during transport 
b. After any patient movement 
c. With any change in patient condition 
d. Upon transfer of care 
 
20. Ventilation should be performed at the correct rate and tidal volume according to the age 
and size of the patient. 
a. Rate should target the lower range of normal by age. 
b. Tidal volumes should be 6-8ml/kg, which is approximated by squeezing the bag just 
sufficiently to observe chest rise. 
c. Ventilation shall be regulated by use of a manometer and/or airflow meter device. 
i. To ensure appropriate ventilatory pressure, a manometer at target 
pressures of <20 cmH
2
O is recommended, with pressure >40 cm most 
harmful. Pressures between 20-40 cm may be needed to ventilate some 
patients but with caution. 
ii. To ensure appropriate ventilatory volume, use of an airflow meter device 
is recommended, especially when using a bag with >1000mL volume.

21. Apply a viral filter during positive-pressure ventilation for patients with suspected 
communicable respiratory illness (e.g., COVID-19, influenza) and to all patients during 
periods of respiratory or emerging infectious disease surge (as supplies allow). 
 
22. Sedation may be administered by paramedics as needed during transport of intubated 
patients. This sedation may only be administered after the patient is intubated and may 
not be administered to facilitate intubation.
