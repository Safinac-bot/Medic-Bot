Medical Control Guideline: NEEDLE THORACOSTOMY 
PRINCIPLES:  
1. Needle thoracostomy is an uncommon procedure that may provide life-saving treatment 
of a tension pneumothorax during prehospital care and transport.  
2. Risk of tension pneumothorax increases significantly after initiation of positive pressure 
ventilation (e.g., bag-mask ventilation, placement of advanced airway), which can 
convert a simple pneumothorax into a tension pneumothorax.  
3. Needle thoracostomy should be performed, if indicated as outlined in Guidelines 2.1 
below, prior to Base contact on any of the following patients: 
• PEA cardiac arrest with multisystem blunt trauma 
• Penetrating trauma which includes the thorax and abdomen or who have 
evidence of chest trauma with profound shock and signs of tension 
pneumothorax.  
4. PEA cardiac arrest maybe due to tension pneumothorax after positive pressure 
ventilation.  
5. ALS and Paramedic Assessment Units shall carry an 8cm (3.0 – 3.5 inches) 14G 
commercial needle decompression device for the performance of emergency needle 
thoracostomy. 
6. The procedure for needle thoracostomy in a pediatric patient is unchanged from that of 
adults. It is expected that a shorter distance will need to be traversed to enter the pleural 
space in children due to the thinner chest wall. 
7. Maintenance of skills requires regular in-service training on recognition and treatment of 
tension pneumothorax. It is strongly recommended that this training be completed in a 
simulation environment, rather than through slide-based or didactic learning. 
GUIDELINES:  
1. Manage patient with traumatic injuries as per TP 1243/1243-P, Traumatic Arrest and/or 
TP 1244/1244-P, Traumatic Injury.  
2. Consider tension pneumothorax in the following patients.  
2.1. Trauma patients with obvious chest trauma (e.g., open chest wounds, evidence of 
crush or flail segment) or with mechanism consistent with chest trauma who 
demonstrate: 
a. Decreased or absent breath sounds on affected side, and  
b. SBP < 90mmHg (adult), hypotension relative to size per MCG 1309 (child 
and infant), and 
c. One or more of the following:  

SUBJECT:  NEEDLE THORACOSTOMY REFERENCE NO. 1335 
 
REVISED: 01-01-25 PAGE 2 OF 2
  
i. Altered mental status  
ii. Severe respiratory distress, with RR > 30 breaths per minute or    
< 10 breaths per minute  
iii. Severe hypoxia, with < 90% oxygen saturation  
iv. Cool, pale, moist skin  
2.2. Traumatic full arrest with PEA rhythm (bilateral needle thoracostomy should be 
performed if evidence of chest wall trauma) 
2.3. Trauma patients requiring positive-pressure ventilation who develop hypoxia or 
hypotension (SBP < 90mmHg for adults, or relative to size for infants and children), 
without alternate cause, after initiation of positive pressure ventilation  
2.4. PEA cardiac arrest that develops after initiating positive pressure ventilation  
3. Immediately place all patients with suspected pneumothorax on high flow oxygen by 
non-rebreather mask. 
4. If the patient is awake and alert, explain medical condition and rationale for the 
procedure to the patient.  
5. Prepare skin of chest with alcohol or chlorhexidine prior to skin puncture.  
6. Insert the needle-catheter perpendicular to chest just above the 3
rd
 rib at the mid-
clavicular line (second intercostal space) or just above the 5
th
 or 6
th
 rib (fourth or fifth 
intercostal space) just anterior to the midaxillary line per training. Only place in sites for 
which paramedic has undergone specific training. 
7. Attach a syringe to the thoracostomy needle for the procedure, if possible. Advance 
needle perpendicular to the chest wall while withdrawing on syringe until air is easily 
aspirated into the syringe (confirming penetration of lung pleura). Advance needle an 
additional 5 mm, then advance catheter over the needle further before withdrawing 
needle and disconnecting the syringe. For pediatric patients, insert no more than half the 
length of the needle or 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) as this is adequate in children under 15 years 
to enter the pleural space. 
8. Secure catheter to skin with tape or commercial device. Do not place a one-way valve 
on the catheter hub. 
9. If the patient has an open or sucking chest wound, cover the wound with a commercially 
available vented chest seal or vented (3-sided) occlusive dressing. Placement of a 
vented dressing can prevent conversion of an open pneumothorax to a tension 
pneumothorax. However, tension pneumothorax may still develop in the presence of a 
vented dressing and should be treated with needle thoracostomy. Furthermore, needle 
thoracostomy in a patient with evidence of tension pneumothorax should not be delayed 
for placement of dressing. 
10. If a patient does not improve after needle thoracostomy, or improves but later 
decompensates, and there is concern for catheter dislodgement or obstruction, needle 
thoracostomy may be repeated on the same side or at an alternate location.
