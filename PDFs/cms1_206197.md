PURPOSE: To identify the policy adopted by the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors for staffing Advanced Life Support (ALS) units. 
 
POLICY: “All ALS units, both public and private, shall be staffed with at least two 
State licensed paramedics accredited in Los Angeles County, two mobile 
intensive care nurses (MICN), a combination of paramedic and MICN, or 
the combination of a paramedic and an Advanced Practice Provider 
(Physician Assistant or Nurse Practitioner) who has completed an 
orientation program approved by the Los Angeles County EMS Agency. 
Exceptions may be made on a temporary basis in those instances where 
one member of the ALS unit is injured, becomes ill, or is otherwise 
incapacitated while on duty or is unavailable for duty because of unusual 
and unforeseen circumstances, and therefore is unable to perform as a 
member of the unit, for a period not to exceed the end of the scheduled 
shift. In each instance where an ALS unit operates with less than the 
minimum staff stated herein, it shall be reported at the end of the calendar 
month to the Director of Emergency Medical Services Agency.”
