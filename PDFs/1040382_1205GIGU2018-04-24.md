SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   When evaluating a patient with abdominal pain, note that abdominal pain may be a sign of cardiac 
disease. If age ≥ 35 years, previous history of cardiac disease or MI, or risk factors are present 
(hypertension, diabetes mellitus), consider obtaining a 12-lead ECG to evaluate for ischemia or 
STEMI. 
 
❷   For both upper and lower GI bleeding, if abdominal pain is also present, document GI bleeding as   
primary provider impression and abdominal pain as secondary provider impression.
