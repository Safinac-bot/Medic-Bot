Article 1. Ambulances 
  Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 2006 (EMTALA) 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Emergency Medical Condition: A condition or situation in which an individual has an 
immediate need for medical attention. The presence of abnormal vital signs (heart rate and 
rhythm, respiratory rate, blood pressure – except in isolated asymptomatic hypertension, 
oxygen saturation) are also indications of an emergency medical condition. Patients who meet 
any criteria for Base Contact or Receiving Hospital Notification (as listed in Ref. No. 1200.1 
Treatment Protocols General Instructions) are also considered to have an emergency medical 
condition. These conditions include, but is not limited to, the following: 
 
• Anaphylaxis 
• Cardiopulmonary arrest 
• Bradydysrhythmias and Tachydysrhythmias 
• Patients in labor 
• Persistent altered level of consciousness (new onset) 
• Respiratory distress and/or failure 
• Signs or symptoms of shock 
• Signs and symptoms of stroke 
• Status epilepticus 
• Suspected cardiac chest pain or discomfort 
• Severe traumatic injuries 
 
Extremis: A life-threatening, time critical situation (e.g., unmanageable airway, uncontrollable 
hemorrhage) that, without immediate stabilization, could result in serious and immediate 
jeopardy to the health of an individual (in the case of a pregnant woman, the health of the 
woman or her unborn child), such that the patient’s life would be jeopardized by transportation 
to any destination but the most accessible receiving (MAR) facility. 
 
Health Facility: A health facility may include, but not limited to, any of the following: 
 
General Acute Care Hospital 
Skilled Nursing Facility

 TRANSPORT/RESPONSE GUIDELINES 
 
 
PAGE 2 OF 6 
Clinic/Urgent Care Center 
Physician Office 
Dialysis Center 
Intermediate Care Facility 
Acute Psychiatric Facility 
 
Interfacility Transport (IFT): The transport of a patient from one health facility to another 
health facility as defined above. 
 
Response Time: The time from initial dispatch to arrival at the physical location/address of 
incident 
 
9-1-1 Response: An emergency response by the primary emergency transportation provider or 
its designee for that geographic area in which the response is requested. Requests for a 9-1-1 
response are generally made by the public but may include requests from health facilities. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. A private provider agency must be licensed by the County of Los Angeles as a Basic Life 
Support provider. Each of the company’s ambulance vehicles that operate within the 
County of Los Angeles shall also be licensed by the County. 
 
2. Private provider agencies are prohibited from dispatching an ambulance to any call that 
would normally be considered an emergency 9-1-1 call for the authorized emergency 
transportation provider for that geographical area. A private provider agency may only 
dispatch an ambulance to such a call if the request is from either the 9-1-1 jurisdictional 
provider or the primary emergency transportation provider requesting backup services. 
 
3. Any ambulance personnel observing the scene of a traffic collision or other emergency 
should: 
 
a. Contact their respective dispatch center and request that the jurisdictional 9-1-1 
provider agency be notified 
 
b. Follow the internal policy developed by their employer in regard to stopping at the 
scene of an observed emergency 
 
4. It is the responsibility of the requested transport provider, in consultation with the facility 
requesting the transport, to provide the appropriate level of transport (Basic Life Support, 
Advanced Life Support or Specialty Care Transport) based on the transferring 
physician’s determination of the medical needs of the patient (Refer to Ref. No. 517.1, 
Guidelines for Determining Level of Interfacility Transport). At minimum, one (1) 
transport personnel must accompany the patient and occupy the patient compartment at 
all times. 
 
5. Health facilities shall provide the transport personnel with appropriate transfer 
documents in compliance with Title 22 and EMTALA transfer requirements. 
 
6. A health facility may not have the staffing and equipment available to assess, treat 
and/or monitor a patient for extended time frames. Therefore, 9-1-1 emergency 
responses may be necessary for those patients whose condition may deteriorate while 
waiting for a private provider response.

 TRANSPORT/RESPONSE GUIDELINES 
 
 
PAGE 3 OF 6 
7. If it is known that transfer arrangements were not made, the transporting unit shall make 
every possible effort to contact the receiving facility and advise them of the patient’s 
imminent arrival. This may be done through the provider’s dispatch center. 
 
8. Patients with a valid Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) form or order; or Physician Orders for 
Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) shall be transported as outlined in Reference No. 
815, et. al. 
 
9. The transferring physician, in consultation with the receiving physician, assumes 
responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the transfer. It is not the 
responsibility of the base hospital or the transport personnel to determine whether the 
transfer is appropriate. 
 
10. Private provider agencies shall ensure that a patient care record (PCR) is completed for 
each patient transport performed including, but not limited to, critical care transports.  
The PCR shall include documentation regarding patient monitoring and care during 
transport, from the time of the patient contact at the sending facility until transfer of care 
at the receiving health facility or other patient destination. For patients transported to a 
health facility, each private provider agency shall ensure there is a mechanism in place 
to provide the receiving facility with a copy of the transport PCR at the time of transfer of 
care. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Transport Modalities 
 
A. Basic Life Support (BLS) Transport 
 
1. Unit is staffed with two EMTs 
 
2. Requests may be for emergency or non-emergency response 
 
3. Patient requires care which does not exceed the Los Angeles County 
EMT scope of practice 
 
4. Patient does not have an emergency medical condition (as defined 
above) at the time of transport 
 
5. Patients who develops an extremis condition enroute shall be diverted to 
the most accessible facility appropriate to the needs of the patient. 
 
B. Advanced Life Support (ALS) Transport 
 
1. Unit is staffed with two paramedics unless the ambulance provider has 
been given approval by the EMS Agency to staff ALS IFT units with one 
paramedic and one EMT. 
 
2. Requests may be for emergency or non-emergency response.  
 
3. Patient requires skills or treatment modalities which do not exceed the 
Los Angeles County paramedic scope of practice.

 TRANSPORT/RESPONSE GUIDELINES 
 
 
PAGE 4 OF 6 
4. Base hospital contact is not required to monitor therapies established by 
the sending facility prior to transport if such therapies fall within the Los 
Angeles County paramedic scope of practice. 
 
5. If the patient’s condition deteriorates or warrants additional therapies 
enroute, paramedics shall treat the patient in accordance with Ref. No. 
1200, Treatment Protocols, et al. and make Base contact. The base 
hospital will determine if the patient may be transported to the original 
destination requested by the sending facility, which should occur 
whenever possible, or if the patient requires diversion to the most 
accessible receiving facility appropriate to the needs of the patient. 
 
6. Paramedics may not accept standing orders or medical orders from the 
transferring physician or provider medical director. 
 
C. Nurse and/or Respiratory Care Practitioner (RCP) Specialty Care Transport 
(SCT) 
 
1. Unit is staffed by a qualified registered nurse and/or RCP and two EMTs 
or paramedics. Other medical personnel (e.g., physician, perfusionist, 
etc.) may be added to meet the needs of the patient. 
 
2. Requests may be for emergency or non-emergency response. 
 
3. Patient requires, or may require, skills or treatment modalities that are 
within the nurse’s and/or RCP’s scope of practice. 
 
4. Registered nurses and RCPs are not required to make base hospital 
contact. Nurses and RCPs may follow medical orders of the transferring 
physician and/or orders approved by their SCT Medical Director within 
their applicable scope of practice for patient care enroute. However, if 
paramedic(s) are part of the SCT transport team, they can only perform 
medical orders received from a base hospital. 
 
5. Patient destination requested by the sending facility will be honored; 
however, if the patient’s condition deteriorates enroute, the registered 
nurse or RCP may determine it is in the patient’s best interest to divert the 
patient to the most accessible facility appropriate to the needs of the 
patient. 
 
II.  Transport Requests and Response Levels 
 
A. If a transport request is received under the following circumstances and it is 
determined that the patient has an emergency medical condition, the dispatcher 
shall immediately refer the request to the jurisdictional 9-1-1 provider. 
 
1. A private citizen requesting ambulance transportation 
 
2. If the patient is at a health facility but has not been evaluated and 
stabilized to the extent possible by a physician prior to the facility 
requesting transport 
 
B. If upon arrival at a health facility or private residence and EMTs or paramedics 
find that the patient has an emergency medical condition, the EMS personnel 

SUBJECT: PRIVATE PROVIDER AGENCY REFERENCE NO. 517 
 TRANSPORT/RESPONSE GUIDELINES 
 
 
PAGE 5 OF 6 
shall determine whether it is in the best interest of the patient to request the 
jurisdictional 9-1-1 provider to respond or to provide treatment and rapid 
transport to the most accessible receiving facility. If on-scene personnel 
determine that immediate transport is indicated, the jurisdictional 9-1-1 provider 
shall be notified and justification shall be documented on the patient care record. 
 
C. Emergency Response Requests  
 
1. Request by a 9-1-1 Provider Agency 
 
Ambulance providers shall dispatch an ambulance within the maximum 
response times for emergency calls specified in the County Code in 
response to an emergency call from a public safety agency or authorized 
emergency transportation provider for that geographical area, unless the 
caller is immediately advised of a delay in responding to the call. 
Response times for emergency and non-emergent request are as follows: 
 
a. For an emergent response (code 3) maximum response times are: 
Urban area – 8 min and 59 seconds (five hundred thirty-nine (539) 
seconds) 
Rural area – 20 min and 59 seconds (twelve hundred fifty-nine 
(1259) seconds) 
Wilderness area – as soon as possible 
 
b.  For a non-emergent (code 2) the maximum response times are: 
Urban area – 15 minutes and 59 seconds (nine hundred fifty-nine 
(959) seconds) 
Rural area – 25 minutes (one thousand five hundred (1,500) 
seconds) 
Wilderness area – as soon as possible 
 
2. Request by a Health Facility  
 
a. If a physician in the emergency department at the health facility 
has evaluated and stabilized the patient to the extent possible and 
arranged an interfacility transfer, a private ground (or air) 
ambulance transport may be arranged and the jurisdictional 9-1-1 
provider is not ordinarily contacted. 
 
b. The jurisdictional 9-1-1 provider may only be contacted if the 
ETA of the private provider is delayed and the condition of 
the patient warrants a rapid response and transport suggests 
that there is an acute threat to life or limb that warrants 
immediate response and transport. Patient destination will 
then be determined as outlined in the applicable patient 
destination policy. 
 
D. Non-Emergency Response Requests - Request by a Health Facility or Private 
Citizen  
 
 
 

SUBJECT: PRIVATE PROVIDER AGENCY REFERENCE NO. 517 
 TRANSPORT/RESPONSE GUIDELINES 
 
 
PAGE 6 OF 6 
 
1. A request for transport of a patient who has, or is perceived to have a 
stabilized medical condition that requires transport, and the patient does 
not have an emergency medical condition 
 
2. Transports are handled by a private ambulance provider with BLS, ALS, 
or SCT staffed units, depending upon the medical requirements of the 
patient and the EMS personnel’s scope of practice 
  
III. Role of the Base Hospital in ALS Interfacility Transports 
 
A. Provide immediate medical direction to paramedics if the patient’s condition 
deteriorates or warrants additional therapies during transport. 
 
B. Determine if the patient may be transported to the original destination requested 
by the sending facility, which should occur whenever possible, or if the patient 
requires diversion to the most accessible receiving facility appropriate to the 
needs of the patient if the patient’s condition changes while enroute to the pre- 
designated facility. If diverted, the base hospital shall: 
 
1. Contact the new receiving hospital and communicate all appropriate 
patient information. 
 
2. Advise the original receiving hospital that a diversion has occurred. 
 
C. Clarify the scope of practice of EMS personnel when requested to do so by a 
sending facility.
