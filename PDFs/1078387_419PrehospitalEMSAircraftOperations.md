PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. The Los Angeles County EMS Agency is responsible for the integration of EMS aircraft 
into the Los Angeles County EMS patient transport system and for the development of 
policies and procedures related to the integration of this specialized resource. EMS 
aircraft operating in Los Angeles County must be classified and authorized by the EMS 
Agency in order to provide prehospital patient transport. 
 
2. EMS aircraft providers (excluding agencies of the federal government) who provide or 
make available prehospital air transport or medical personnel, either directly or indirectly, 
or any hospital where an EMS aircraft is based, housed, or stationed permanently or 
temporarily, shall adhere to all federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, policies, 
and procedures related to EMS aircraft operations, including qualifications of flight crews 
and aircraft maintenance. 
 
3. Availability and appropriateness of EMS aircraft transport shall be determined by the 
primary EMS provider agency on scene. This will be based on the patient’s status, 
ground ambulance response time, and proximity to a receiving facility staffed and 
equipped to meet the needs of the patient(s), i.e., trauma centers, pediatric trauma 
center, etc. versus the most accessible receiving facility (MAR). 
 
4. If base hospital contact is established and directing the patient’s care, the base hospital 
shall be the medical authority in determining patient destination and treatment in 
accordance with all applicable prehospital care policies. 
 
5. No EMS aircraft shall respond to an incident without formal dispatch from a designated 
dispatch center or request from the primary provider agency responsible for the area in 
which the incident has occurred. 
 
6. The primary provider agency requesting EMS aircraft response shall assume medical 
management responsibility at the scene and shall be responsible for proper protection of 
the emergency landing site during its use in the event that a licensed heliport is not 
available. This shall include, but not be limited to, fire protection, rescue services, 
exclusion of extraneous individuals, control of duties performed in the immediate vicinity 
of the aircraft (special attention will be paid to the main rotor, the tail rotor, and the 
effects of rotor downwash), and patient protection during landing. 
 
7. The authority for safety of the EMS aircraft and persons associated with the EMS aircraft 
shall rest with the Pilot In Command (PIC). This shall include the supervision of those 
persons directly involved in loading/unloading patients and/or supplies. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Dispatch Criteria 
 
Availability and appropriateness of EMS aircraft transport shall be determined by the 
primary provider agency on scene with regard to, but not limited to, the following: 
 
A. The determination of ground versus air transport should be based on the time of 
day, incident location, weather conditions, traffic obstructions, etc. 
 
B. An EMS aircraft should be considered for dispatch to an incident any time ground 

SUBJECT: PREHOSPITAL EMS AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS REFERENCE NO. 419 
 
 
PAGE 3 OF 6 
response will result in an extended estimated time of arrival, and/or incident 
location is inaccessible by ground ambulance. 
 
C. If aeromedical transport is indicated and the requested/most accessible EMS 
aircraft is unavailable or has declined the request due to conditions not 
conducive to air transport, the next most accessible EMS aircraft provider should 
be requested, until all resources have been exhausted. If a request for services is 
refused by a particular provider (e.g. weather), the reason for the flight refusal will 
be conveyed to any subsequent recipient of the request for service. 
 
D. Patients meeting trauma center criteria should be transported by EMS aircraft 
when a trauma center cannot be accessed by ground within 30 minutes (Ref. No. 
506, Trauma Triage). 
 
E. For patients requiring ALS level care whose condition is deteriorating and 
transport to a 9-1-1 receiving facility is extended, transport by EMS aircraft may 
be considered. 
 
F. The designated dispatch center or primary provider agency 
requesting/dispatching EMS aircraft responses shall notify the following 
facilities/agencies as early as possible, and prior to patient/EMS aircraft arrival.  
Examples of these facilities/agencies include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
1. Local fire department 
 
2. Local law enforcement for scene jurisdiction 
 
3. Base hospital, if applicable, in accordance with established policies and 
procedures. 
 
4. Receiving hospital (when possible, the receiving hospital should be 
notified by both the EMS Aircraft and the base hospital handling the call). 
 
5. Medical Alert Center 
 
G. Dispatch of EMS aircraft may not be appropriate under certain circumstances 
and patients may require transport to the most accessible 9-1-1 receiving facility 
(MAR) staffed and equipped to handle the patient in compliance with State and 
local EMS policies and procedures. 
 
1. The patient has an uncontrollable life-threatening situation (e.g., 
obstructed airway). 
 
2. There are conditions not conducive to air transport such as inadequate 
landing site, poor weather, etc. 
 
3. Air transport is not immediately available when the patient is ready for 
transport and the risks of delaying transport outweigh the risks of 
transporting by ground. 
 
II. Cancelation 
 
A. When an EMS aircraft response has been requested, the decision to cancel the 

SUBJECT: PREHOSPITAL EMS AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS REFERENCE NO. 419 
 
 
PAGE 4 OF 6 
EMS aircraft may be made by one or more of the following, as appropriate for the 
incident: 
 
1. Primary provider EMS personnel 
 
2. Incident commander 
 
3. PIC of the EMS aircraft 
 
4. Requesting personnel and/or organization 
 
5. Base Hospital Physician 
 
B. The designated dispatch center or primary provider agency managing the 
requests for an EMS aircraft shall notify all affected parties of the cancelation of 
an EMS aircraft. 
 
III. Patient Destination/Landing Sites 
 
A. The base hospital directing the patient’s care shall determine patient destination in 
accordance with the applicable patient destination policies, provided the receiving 
facility has a State approved and licensed heliport or designated landing site.  
Hospital diversion status is also a consideration in determining patient destination. 
The base hospital shall contact the receiving facility and relay all pertinent 
information concerning the patient’s condition. 
 
B. If base hospital contact cannot be established or maintained, the decision for 
patient destination shall be made by the highest medical authority on scene.  
Hospital diversion status may be obtained from the Medical Alert Center (MAC) or 
via the ReddiNet system. Pertinent patient information and ETA should be relayed 
directly to the receiving hospital, through the MAC or the designated dispatch 
center. 
 
C. All applicable destination policies will be followed for patients treated under Ref. 
No. 1200, Treatment Protocols, et al. Hospital diversion status and availability of a 
State approved, and licensed heliport or designated landing site are factors that 
need to be considered. Paramedics shall contact the receiving facility directly and 
relay all required information concerning the patient’s condition. If the aircraft is 
unable to communicate with the receiving facility (terrain related), all efforts should 
be made to communicate with the receiving facility via the base hospital, dispatch 
center, or the MAC. 
 
D. All patient destinations, with respect to safety factors, shall be approved by the 
PIC. 
 
E. In all situations where temporary emergency landing sites are used, the PIC of 
each EMS aircraft will exercise primary authority and responsibility for the safe 
operation of the aircraft. If a hospital with a State approved and licensed heliport 
or designated landing site is in proximity to an incident requiring EMS aircraft 
transport, such heliport or landing site may be utilized for continuation of the 9-1-1 
call and is not in violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor 
Act (EMTALA).

F. When pediatric and adult trauma patients are transported together in one aircraft, 
the receiving trauma center shall also be a pediatric trauma center. 
 
IV. Communication/Record Keeping 
 
A. EMS aircraft shall have the capability of communicating with each of the following: 
 
1. Designated dispatch center 
 
2. EMS ground units at scene of an emergency 
 
3. Designated base hospitals 
 
4. Receiving hospitals 
 
5. Other appropriate facilities or agencies 
 
6. Required FAA facilities 
 
B. Whenever possible, direct communication should be established. 
 
C. All EMS aircraft shall utilize appropriate radio frequencies for dispatch, routing 
and coordination of flights. This excludes use of Med 1-8 and Hospital 
Emergency Administrative Radio (V MED 28) for these purposes. 
 
D. Each EMS aircraft shall establish base hospital contact with their assigned base 
hospital or the appropriate area base hospital pursuant to Ref. No. 1200, 
Treatment Protocols, et al., unless the call is a prearranged, specialty center, 
interfacility transfer. 
 
E. When receiving a patient(s) from ground units, the medical flight crew shall 
ensure that, if applicable, base hospital contact has been made and/or continued.  
Such contact shall not unnecessarily delay patient transport. 
 
F. In the event voice communication cannot be established or maintained with the 
base hospital, paramedics shall utilize Ref. No. 1200, Treatment Protocols, et al. 
 
G. All applicable prehospital care policies and procedures related to record keeping 
shall apply to EMS aircraft operations.  The EMS Record should be available to 
the receiving facility at transfer of care, or as soon as feasible. 
 
V. Medical Control 
 
A. All EMS policies and procedures for medical control and patient destination shall 
apply to the medical flight crew. 
 
B. In situations where the medical flight crew is less medically qualified than the 
ground personnel from whom they receive patients, the medical flight crew may 
assume patient care responsibility only in accordance with policies and 
procedures established by the EMS Agency. 
 
C. Medical flight crewmembers who have an expanded scope of practice 
(Physicians/RNs) beyond Ref. No. 803, Paramedic Scope of Practice, may only 

SUBJECT: PREHOSPITAL EMS AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS REFERENCE NO. 419 
 
 
PAGE 6 OF 6 
utilize specific treatments/procedures for which they are licensed, trained and 
qualified. In such cases, notification to the receiving facility shall be made and 
base hospital medical direction is not required. 
 
D. If a physician is aboard an EMS aircraft, under no circumstances will the 
presence of said physician endorse the violation of recognized limits of scope of 
practice of any EMT-I, paramedic, or RN aboard the aircraft. 
 
VI. Quality Improvement 
 
A. The EMS Agency, base hospitals, trauma centers, and provider agencies shall 
conduct regular review of all trauma related EMS aircraft responses. 
 
B. Documentation on the Patient Care Report and Base Hospital Form should 
include an explanation for the use of an air ambulance (i.e., mountain rescue).
