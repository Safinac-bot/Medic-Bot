Paramedic Provider Agency: An agency that is approved by the Los Angeles County EMS 
Agency to sponsor paramedics, meeting the requirements as outlined in Ref. No. 406, 
Authorization for Paramedic Provider Status, and has a written agreement with the EMS Agency 
to participate in the EMS system and comply with all applicable state regulations, local policies, 
and procedures, including participation in EMS quality improvement programs. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Los Angeles County based law enforcement (LE) agencies may have paramedic 
personnel trained to provide ALS level care in the prehospital setting. In many instances, 
LE are first on scene to a medical emergency or are operating in tactical environments 
that are high risk for medical emergencies to occur. 
 
2. Law enforcement agencies may have assets (e.g., helicopter resources) that fulfill a 
specific function in the Los Angeles County EMS system or be designated jurisdictional 
providers and require EMS personnel able to operate with an ALS scope of practice. 
 
3. Law enforcement tactical operations require preplanning and the support of medical 
personnel specifically trained to provide medical care and respond to tactical medical 
emergencies. 
 
4. Locally accredited LE paramedics who have completed required training may provide a 
beneficial service to the community when first on scene, bridging ALS care until a 9-1-1 
jurisdictional paramedic provider agency arrives. 
 
5. Skills maintenance and quality improvement are important components for sustaining 
paramedic provider competency.  LE Paramedic Provider Agencies must ensure active 
clinical practice for their paramedics as well as quality improvement programs. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. LE Paramedic Provider Agency Requirements 
 
A. LE agencies may sponsor their locally accredited paramedics upon EMS Agency 
approval as a Paramedic Provider Agency. 
 
B. All LE Paramedic Provider Agencies shall: 
 
1. Follow the requirements outlined in Ref. No. 406, Authorization for 
Paramedic Provider Status, for Paramedic Provider Agency status 
approval. 
 
2. Have and retain a Medical Director that meets the requirements of Ref. 
No. 411, Provider Agency Medical Director. 
 
3. Maintain continuing education and quality improvement programs.

Assessment Unit as per Ref. No 416, Assessment Unit.
