Classification 
 Antidysrhythmic 
 
LA County Prehospital Indications 
Cardiac Arrest – Non-Traumatic (adult and pediatric): pulseless ventricular tachycardia or 
persistent/recurrent ventricular fibrillation (i.e., continued VT/VF after 3 defibrillations) 
 
Other Common Indications (Not authorized for EMS administration in LA County) 
Ventricular tachycardia with pulses and adequate perfusion, 
Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with rapid ventricular rate unresponsive to other treatments 
 
Adult Dose 
300mg (6mL) IV/IO 
May repeat 150mg (3mL) IV/IO x1 prn after additional defibrillation x2, max total dose 450mg 
Pediatric Dose 
5mg/kg (50mg/mL) IV/IO dose per MCG 1309, max total dose 300mg 
 
Mechanism of Action 
Class III antiarrhythmic agent, which inhibits adrenergic stimulation; affects sodium, potassium, and 
calcium channels; markedly prolongs action potential and delays repolarization; decreases AV conduction 
and sinus node function 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset minutes after IV bolus administration  
 
Contraindications 
None in cardiac arrest 
 
Interactions 
 None in cardiac arrest 
 
Adverse Effects 
Bradysrhythmias 
Congestive heart failure  
Hypotension 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac rhythm closely post resuscitation 
• Should not be used routinely in cardiac arrest. For use only in ventricular fibrillation or ventricular 
tachycardia without pulses unresponsive to attempted defibrillation x2
