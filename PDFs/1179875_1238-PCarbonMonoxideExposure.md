SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶    Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, altered level of consciousness, malaise, 
nausea, dizziness and unresponsiveness. Consider carbon monoxide when multiple persons in same 
location present with any of these symptoms. 
 
❷    The measured carbon monoxide level should not impact the transport decision. It will be helpful for 
hospital treatment of the exposure. 
 
❸    Exposures to certain chemicals can be associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. For example, 
methylene chloride (dichloromethane) is an industrial solvent and a component of paint remover. It is 
metabolized to carbon monoxide by the liver and may cause carbon monoxide toxicity if inhaled or 
ingested.
