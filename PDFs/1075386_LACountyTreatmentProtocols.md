REVISED: 07-01-25 PAGE 6 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
The Treatment Protocols were developed to be consistent with EMS Provider Impressions as approved 
by the California EMS Authority.  The foundations for the revised guidelines are the EMT and paramedic 
scope of practice, medical research, and community standards in medical practice.  
 
GENERAL INFORMATION 
 
1. Patients with the same disease may have differing symptoms and presentations, and conversely, 
patients with similar signs and symptoms may have very different diagnoses. 
 
2. The Treatment Protocols guide treatment of “classic” presentations based on evidence-based 
practice. EMTs, Paramedics, mobile intensive care nurses (MICNs) and Base hospital physicians 
must utilize their medical knowledge, expertise and critical thinking to determine appropriate 
treatment for each patient. 
 
3. The protocols were not developed with the intent that all therapies be done on scene. Transport 
of patients with treatment en route is left to the discretion of the field unit and the Base hospital. 
 
4. The protocols incorporate EMS policies that address EMT and Paramedic Scope of Practice, 
Procedures Prior to Base Contact, Base Hospital Contact, and Standing Field Treatment 
Protocols.  Assessments and treatments recommended would be carried out by an EMT and/or a 
paramedic based on their scope of practice.  
 
5. Treatments may be ordered by Mobile Intensive Care Nurses (MICNs) providing online medical 
direction as indicated in the protocols. In addition, MICNs may provide orders for pain 
management per their clinical judgment up to a maximum adult total dose of Fentanyl 250mcg or 
Morphine 20mg or, for pediatrics, Fentanyl or Morphine up to a maximum of 4 total doses per 
MCG 1309. 
 
PROTOCOL FORMAT 
 
1. Pharmacologic agents are in BOLD typeface. 
 
2. In general, each protocol will have a corresponding pediatric specific protocol. The pediatric 
protocols are identified with a letter “P” at the end of the protocol number and have the Los 
Angeles County teddy bear symbol.  
 
3. In preparation for an on-line mobile application, the protocols were developed to provide linkages 
to additional helpful information specific to the provider impression and/or specific patient 
population, such as the Medical Control Guidelines (MCG) and patient destination policies. These 
are indicated in BLUE in the protocols as hyperlinks. 
 
USING THE TREATMENT PROTOCOLS 
 
1. Utilize Ref. No. 1201, Assessment as a starting point until a Provider Impression is established. 
 
2. If more than one treatment protocol applies, begin by using the one most closely associated with 
the patient’s symptoms and prioritize interventions based on your judgment.

Treatment Protocol: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Ref. No. 1200.1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
REVISED: 07-01-25 PAGE 7 OF 447 
Based on the patient’s presentation and the assessment, the EMT or Paramedic determines 
his/her Provider Impression.  In general, Provider Impressions are categorized according to body 
systems.  Each Provider Impression has a corresponding Treatment Protocol.   
 
BODY SYSTEM 
 Provider Impression/Protocol Name  Protocol Number 
 
A Treatment Protocol may be applicable to more than one Provider Impression.  Also, rarely, a 
Provider Impression may be further divided into more than one Treatment Protocol, e.g. 
management for the Provider Impression ‘Cardiac Dysrhythmia’ is guided by TP 1212, Cardiac 
Dysrhythmia - Bradycardia or TP 1213, Cardiac Dysrhythmia - Tachycardia depending on the 
dysrhythmia. 
 
3. Refer to the appropriate Treatment Protocol(s) to guide patient treatment. The treatment protocol 
sequence is intended to guide the priority in which interventions are administered but not to imply 
a strict order as priorities in an individual patient may differ. 
 
4. If the patient’s status changes, a different treatment protocol might be needed. When using the 
new treatment protocol, take into account the treatments already performed. 
 
5. These protocols are designed for the Paramedic however, the EMT provider may use these 
protocols based on their scope of practice and should contact ALS when indicated by their 
assessment as per Ref. 802, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Scope of Practice and Ref 
1200.4, BLS Upgrade to ALS Assessment.  
 
6. All pediatric patients must be measured using a length-based resuscitation tape (e.g., 
Broselow) and the identified color code and weight in kilograms must be reported when 
contacting the Base hospital. The color code and weight in kilograms must be documented for all 
pediatric patients in the patient weight section of the EMS Patient Care Record (ePCR or EMS 
Report Form). Medication dosages are determined by correlating the length-based resuscitation 
tape color code with the appropriate weight on the Medical Control Guideline (MCG 1309), Color 
Code Drug Doses/L.A. County Kids chart. If the child is longer than the length-based resuscitation 
tape, use adult dosing. 
 
7. A full patient report must be given: 1) If Base hospital contact is made to obtain patient care 
orders or 2) if the patient meets trauma criteria or guidelines but is being transported to a non-
trauma hospital. Once Base hospital contact is made for medical control the overall authority for 
the patient’s medical care lies with the Base. The treatment plan should be developed 
collaboratively by EMS and Base personnel. Treatments outlined in the applicable protocol may 
be administered by EMS personnel and communicated to the Base.  
 
8. Paramedic verbal report to the Base hospital and/or receiving hospital shall be in accordance with 
Ref. 1340, Medical Control Guideline: Online Medical Control and Receiving Hospital Notification. 
 
CONTACT THE BASE HOSPITAL as specified in Ref. 1200.2, Base Contact Requirements 
 
TRANSPORT ALS when either of the following conditions apply: 
 
1. Need for immediate and ongoing ALS intervention (excluding need for a single administration of

medication for symptomatic relief, i.e., morphine, fentanyl, ondansetron) 
 
2. Potential for deterioration en route including but not limited to abnormal vital signs 
 
NOTIFY THE RECEIVING HOSPITAL to expedite care of ALL ALS patients to ensure 9-1-1 receiving 
facilities are prepared with the appropriate resources to receive the patient and to reduce ambulance 
patient offload time (APOT).   
 
1. When operating on treatment protocols without online medical control, paramedics will notify the 
receiving hospital directly. 
 
2. When Base Contact is made, Base personnel will notify the receiving hospital.

PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Base Contact is made by paramedics to establish online medical direction for additional guidance 
on field care beyond what is contained in the offline treatment protocols. 
2. Once the patient is no longer present and under the care of the paramedic medical direction is 
not needed. Therefore, this policy does not apply and Base Contact is not required. 
3. Base Contact for all patients shall be made according to the requirements below and at the 
judgment of the treating paramedic. Access to online medical direction is not limited to those 
conditions listed below. 
 
4. For children 13 to 36 months of age, Base Contact and/or transport is required, except those with 
no medical complaint or with isolated minor extremity injury. 
5. Children less than or equal to 12 months of age must be transported in accordance with Ref. No. 
510, regardless of provider impression or field treatment rendered, and if a parent or caregiver 
refuses transport, Base Contact shall be made prior to signing the patient out Against Medical 
Advice (AMA). 
 
6. Base Contact criteria below still apply if the patient is on scene and refusing transport (AMA). This 
includes parents or legal guardians who refuse transport of a pediatric patient. 
 
7. This document provides a quick reference list for Base Contact requirements; it does not replace 
the treatment protocols or the guidance there within, which shall be followed at all times unless 
otherwise directed by online medical direction. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Base Contact is required when consultation with the base would be helpful such as: 
a. Patient presentation renders the provider impression and appropriate treatment protocol 
unclear 
 
b. Additional or unlisted treatments are required 
 
2. Base Contact is required for children who meet transport guidelines to a Pediatric Medical Center 
(Ref. 510) 
 
3. Base Contact is required for patients in traumatic full arrest who do not meet criteria for 
determination of death per Ref. 814. In these instances, Base Contact shall be made with the 
Trauma Center. 
4. Base Contact is required for the following provider impressions in all patients:

Treatment Protocol: BLS UPGRADE TO ALS ASSESSMENT Ref. No. 1200.4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
REVISED: 07-01-25 PAGE 11 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Emergency Medical Condition:  A condition or situation in which an individual has an immediate need 
for medical attention. The presence of abnormal vital signs (heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, blood 
pressure - except isolated asymptomatic hypertension, oxygen saturation) are also indications of an 
emergency medical condition. Patients who meet any criteria for Base Contact or Receiving Hospital 
Notification are also considered to have an emergency medical condition. 
 
Extremis: A life-threatening, time-critical situation (e.g., unmanageable airway, uncontrollable 
hemorrhage) that, without immediate stabilization, could result in serious and immediate jeopardy to the 
health of an individual (in the case of a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child), 
such that the patient's life would be jeopardized by transportation to any destination but the most 
accessible receiving center (MAR) or for pediatrics the emergency department approved for pediatrics 
(EDAP).  
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. ALS providers, as compared to BLS providers, have additional assessment skills and equipment 
that allow a more thorough evaluation of patients in the field to determine whether an emergency 
medical condition is present.   
 
2. Patients with an emergency medical condition require transport to the emergency department and 
may benefit from ALS care prehospital. 
 
3. Patients released on scene are at increased risk of having a bad outcome. 
 
4. BLS providers should always use their judgment when considering need for an ALS assessment.  
While this document lists when ALS assessment is required prior to transport or release at the 
scene, BLS providers need not be limited by this list and should request an ALS response 
whenever they feel it necessary. 
 
5. For patients in extremis or for those patients for which waiting for ALS may be longer than 
transport to the ED, BLS providers may transport to the closest facility if, in their judgment, this 
will provide the most rapid ALS care for the patient.  
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. If the patient has an emergency medical condition as defined above and a BLS unit is alone on 
scene, the BLS unit should immediately consider whether an ALS assessment is required.  If en 
route, the ALS unit should not be cancelled. 
 
2. Any adult or pediatric patient with a provider impression requiring Base Contact as defined in Ref. 
1200.2 requires ALS assessment and transport unless otherwise directed by online medical 
control.

3 Additionally, an ALS assessment is required for pediatric patients who meet transport guidelines 
to a Pediatric Medical Center and pediatric patients in labor.  An ALS assessment with Base 
Contact is required for patients 13-36 months of age who are not transported (unless no medical 
complaint or with isolated minor extremity injury).  Patients ≤12 months require transport. 
 
4. Finally, patients with the following high-risk features also require an ALS assessment regardless 
of provider impression. The ALS assessment will determine the provider impression and the level 
of transport required. 
 
a. The following abnormal vital signs sustained or deteriorating over two measurements 5 
minutes apart:  
 
i. For adults: 
a. HR ≥ 120  
b. SBP < 90  
c. RR ≥ 24

ii. Altered mental status 
iii. Chest pain (medical cause) 
iv. Severe agitation requiring medication 
v. Shortness of breath

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    EMS personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to accepting 
ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkempt home, evidence of 
drug or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or suspected domestic violence), when the 
history does not match with the severity of physical findings (e.g., child posturing after a roll of the 
couch), when patterned injury or burns are noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, whip marks 
on the skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. This must 
also be accompanied by notification to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). 
 
❷    Parents /caregivers can be concerned about signs and symptoms in children which may not show at 
the time of paramedic assessment. This does not exclude the possibility that an emergency exists. If 
there are not physical signs and the complaint does not otherwise have a provider impression 
associated with it – document No Medical Complaint. 
 
If parents/caregivers have ongoing concerns these patients require transport to an EDAP for 
evaluation

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    When evaluating a patient for chest pain consider age, previous history of cardiac disease or MI, risk 
factors, and signs and symptoms to determine if cardiac chest pain suspected. Obtain a 12-lead ECG 
if age ≥ 35 years and/or patient has risk factors (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, 
personal history of cardiac disease, or family history of early cardiac disease – defined as CAD/MI at 
age <50 years old). 
 
❷    Hypertension in a pregnant or recently post-partum patient is a sign or eclampsia, which requires 
immediate emergency and obstetric care. Additional signs of eclampsia are edema and seizures. 
Patients who are ≥ 20 weeks pregnant or ≤ 6 weeks post-partum with hypertension (BP ≥ 
140/90mmHg should be transported to the ED for evaluation. 
 
❸   For patients with bilateral swelling of lower extremities, evaluate for signs of congestive heart failure. 
Careful examination of breath sounds and vital signs, including respiratory rate and pulse oximetry, 
should be performed. If there are signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema, treat per TP 1214, 
Pulmonary Edema / CHF.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Use judgment based on the clinical status of the patient to determine whether IO placement for 
dextrose and/or fluid administration prior to hospital arrival is warranted.  For altered patients who 
show signs of shock/poor perfusion and/or extremis with severe HYPERglycemia or HYPOglycemia 
and an IV cannot be obtained, an IO may be placed for fluid resuscitation or treatment with dextrose. 
Refer to (MCG 1375).    
 
❷ Patients with hypoglycemia who are successfully treated with oral glucose or Dextrose 10% IV and 
then wish to decline transport to the hospital should be discouraged to do so if they have abnormal 
vital signs, fever, are taking long-acting hypoglycemic agents, history of alcohol abuse, possible 
ingestion or poisoning, or if they DO NOT have a history of diabetes mellitus as these patients are at 
high risk for recurrent hypoglycemic episodes. Patients at low risk are those with diabetes on short 
acting hypoglycemic agents who have someone with them and are able to tolerate oral intake. Low 
risk patients can be assessed, treated and released for follow-up as per Ref. No. 834. If a patient is 
not transported, he/she should be counseled to eat a high protein meal and to call his/her primary 
care physician.  
 
 Long Acting hypoglycemic agents 
• Sulfonylureas: gliclazide, glimepiride, glipizide, gliquidone, glyburide, glyclopyramide,  
• Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), troglitazone (Rezulin) 
• Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: acarbose, miglitol, voglibose 
• Meglitinides – nateglinide, repaglinide 
• Combination drugs: glipizide and metformin (Metaglip), glyburide and metformin (Glucovance), 
pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact), pioglitazone and metformin (ACTOplus Met), rosiglitazone

❸    Glucagon is effective only if there are sufficient glycogen stores in the liver. Patients with low 
glycogen stores such as severe malnutrition, cirrhosis, or adrenal insufficiency may not respond to 
glucagon.  
 
❹   Consider other potential causes of hyperglycemia such as trauma, infection, or myocardial infarction 
and treat as per associated protocols.  
 
❺    Patients with prolonged and/or severe hyperglycemia are at risk for significant volume losses leading 
to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline is recommended 
until their glucose can be lowered with medications.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   An end-tidal CO
2
 (EtCO
2
) reading ≤ 25mmHg strongly supports the provider impression of sepsis in 
patients for whom sepsis is suspected. 
 
❷    Sepsis is defined as the body’s response to infection and may include fever, tachycardia or 
bradycardia, tachypnea, and signs of poor perfusion. Other signs of infection may be present such as 
cough (e.g., pneumonia), painful urination (e.g., urinary tract infection), abdominal pain 
(e.g., appendicitis), headache (e.g., meningitis), or a red swollen extremity (e.g., cellulitis, or 
necrotizing fasciitis). Septic shock is a continuum of signs and symptoms, which includes the 
presence of hypotension and/or evidence of poor perfusion. If infection is present and sepsis with or 
without shock is present document provider impression as Sepsis. 
 
❸    Fever is a natural response of the body to fight infection and may be present without signs of sepsis.  
If fever is present without signs of sepsis (tachypnea, tachycardia, or obvious sign of infection) or 
septic shock (signs of poor perfusion), document the provider impression as Fever. 
 
❹    Certain emerging diseases (e.g., Ebola virus disease) require special isolation procedures and 
transport. Determination of suspected cases must be made in coordination with the Department of 
Public Health (DPH). The Medical Alert Center (MAC) will facilitate DPH consultation and deployment 
of a High-Risk Ambulance (HRA) when indicated. Contact the MAC via phone at (562) 347-1789, 
ReddiNet, or VMED-28.

❶   Shock is inadequate tissue perfusion, equivalent to poor perfusion for the purposes of this protocol. 
 
❷    Maintaining a patient supine improves perfusion to vital organs; raising the lower limbs does not 
provide additional benefit. However, not all patients will tolerate a supine position, which can further 
compromise respiratory function and airway patency.  
 
❸ Exposure to cold increases the likelihood of bleeding complications. 
 
❹ There are many etiologies of shock. The treatment protocols referenced here contain guidance on 
specific interventions beyond what is contained in this treatment protocol. Consider Base contact if 
hypotension/shock of unclear etiology 
 
❺   Push-dose Epinephrine is appropriate for non-traumatic shock including cardiogenic shock.  
Additional doses beyond 10mL may need to be prepared for prolonged transports.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶ Scene safety includes the assessment for the presence of firearms or weapons, including 
observations and direct inquiry with the patient and any available/relevant third parties (e.g., family, 
caregivers, or witnesses). If a weapon is found on the scene, EMS personnel should notify all 
members on the scene, and contact law enforcement (LE) immediately. 
 
❷    Psychiatric, including mental health and substance abuse, emergencies are medical emergencies, 
and as such are best treated by EMS personnel. Those patients with psychiatric emergencies 
presenting with agitation, violence, threats of harm to self or others, or criminal activity are best 
managed by an EMS and LE co-response.  
 
❸    Always attempt verbal de-escalation first and avoid applying restraints to patients who do not present 
a threat to self or EMS personnel (Ref. No. 838, Application of Patient Restraints) 
 
❹     Many medical causes of psychiatric symptoms exist: 
Agitation (see MCG 1307) 
Acute pain 
Head trauma 
Infection 
Encephalitis or Encephalopathy 
Exposure to environmental toxins 
Metabolic derangement 
Hypoxia 
Thyroid disease or other hormone irregularity

Hormonal variations 
Subclinical / clinical hypothyroidism 
Alcohol or recreational drugs: intoxication or withdrawal 
 
❺    Medications used for pharmacologic management of agitation may cause respiratory depression; 
administer only when necessary for the safety of the patients and/or EMS personnel. Apnea can 
occur suddenly and with little warning. Resuscitation equipment (oxygen and bag-mask ventilator) 
should be positioned near the patient and readily available prior to sedation. Every individual who 
receives restraint and/or midazolam pharmacologic management should be continuously monitored 
(including capnography when available) and transported for additional clinical assessment and 
treatment. 
 
❻   Use of restraints in severely agitated patients is associated with an increased risk of sudden death.     
Avoid using restraints in patients who do not present a threat to self or to EMS personnel. Monitor 
patients closely when restraints are applied. Never secure or transport a patient in restraints in prone 
position. 
❼    The IM or IN route is preferred unless an IV has been previously established. 
 
❽     Patients who are larger in size (e.g., ≥100kg) and/or pose a greater risk for harm due to their level of 
agitation and violence may require the higher dose of midazolam for adequate sedation. Patients in 
need of sedation who are smaller, frail, elderly or already exhibiting signs of fatigue should 
preferentially be treated with a 5mg dose, repeating if necessary, to reduce risk of oversedation and 
potential for apnea. 
 
❾     Patients who are agitated while in physical restraint and have the potential for injury due to the 
      degree of agitation, should receive medication by EMS personnel to reduce 
      agitation with continued monitoring for respiratory depression, in accordance with Ref 838, 
      Application of Patient Restraints. 
 
 ❿ Several drugs that may cause agitation and present similarly to a psychiatric crisis may also cause 
life threatening cardiac arrhythmias after intentional or accidental overdose. These arrhythmias are 
often preceded by prolonged QRS intervals (> 0.12 sec) or bradycardia. Cocaine intoxication is 
strongly associated with severe agitation and may also produce cardiac effects similar to Tricyclic 
antidepressant (TCA) overdose (widened QRS progressing to malignant arrhythmia). These patients 
may require a large dose of sodium bicarbonate to prevent sudden cardiac death. Consult Base 
Physician immediately to discussion administration of Sodium Bicarbonate; may repeat x1 if QRS 
remains > 0.12 sec after initial sodium bicarbonate. Treat in conjunction with TP 1241, Overdose / 
Poisoning / Ingestion  
 
⓫     Agitation may be present after a seizure, or in the setting of hypo/hyperglycemia. Consider checking 
           glucose early if the patient is a known diabetic or demonstrates clinical evidence of hypoglycemia, 
       but only if safe to do so. 
 
⓬     It is important to assess for any evidence of suicide attempt. If there is concern for overdose, ask the 
patient or bystanders to provide information on agents used (specifically what, when, and how much). 
Collect and transport any medication vials, or additional pills). This will assist in determining 
necessary antidote treatment and monitoring at the hospital. This information is often lost, if not

 obtained immediately on scene. 
 
⓭   Patients with acute mental health or substance abuse crises may not be capable or willing to provide 
reliable information; therefore, it is important to obtain third party collateral information about the 
patient’s condition (e.g., from family, caregivers, witnesses), including names and contact information

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Maintaining perfusion with high-quality CPR throughout resuscitation is essential to ensuring good 
patient outcome. Transporting the patient in cardiac arrest causes interruptions in CPR and reduces 
CPR quality. Patients who are resuscitated until ROSC on scene have higher neurologically intact 
survival. 
 
❷    Chest compressions are the most important aspect of cardiac arrest resuscitation. Maintaining 
continuous chest compressions should take priority over any medication administration or transport.  
 
❸  Hyperventilation reduces venous return and worsens patient outcomes. Both continuous and 
interrupted (30:2) compressions/ventilations are acceptable. Regardless of ventilation method used, 
ventilations should be no more frequent than 10 per minute with appropriate volume, just enough to 
see chest rise.   
 
❹  Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with a viral filter is the preferred initial method of airway management. 
BMV in cardiac arrest has been associated with improved patient outcomes and advanced airway 
placement should be deferred until after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) unless BMV is 
inadequate. If a decision is made to transport the patient in refractory cardiac arrest, place an 
advanced airway prior to transport. 
 
❺  Supraglottic airway (SGA), e.g., i-gel is the preferred advanced airway unless specifically 
contraindicated. Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, circumstances, 
and skill level when selecting the advanced airway modality. 
 
❻    ETCO
2
 should be > 10 with a “box-shaped” waveform during effective CPR. A flat or wavy waveform 
or ETCO
2
 < 10 may indicate ineffective compressions or airway obstruction. A sudden increase in 
ETCO
2
 is suggestive of ROSC. The waveform can also be used to confirm ventilation rate if an 
advanced airway or asynchronous ventilation with continuous compressions is used. 
 
❼ If you are able to observe the underlying rhythm during compressions via rhythm display technology, 
do not pause for the rhythm check. In order to minimize pauses in chest compressions, pulse checks 
should only be performed during rhythm checks when there is an organized rhythm with signs of 
ROSC, such as normal capnography or sudden rise in capnography. 
 
❽    Patients in persistent cardiac arrest with refractory ventricular fibrillation (rVF) or EMS-witnessed 
arrest of presumed cardiac etiology may have a good outcome despite prolonged resuscitation. Early 
transport may be initiated using a mechanical compression device when routing a patient to a STEMI 
Receiving Center (SRC) for initiation of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). When 
ECPR is not available due to transport time or other criteria not met, resuscitation may be continued 
on scene for up to 40 minutes, as long as resources allow, in order to maximize the chances for field 
ROSC, which is strongly associated with improved survival with good neurologic outcome.  
 
❾ Changing the pad position, called vector change, from anterior-lateral to anterior-posterior or vice 
versa in patients who do not respond to initial defibrillation attempts, increases the chances of 
converting to a perfusing rhythm. 
 
❿ Epinephrine may improve outcomes if given early in non-shockable rhythms, but can worsen

outcomes early in shockable rhythms, where defibrillation is the preferred initial treatment. 
Epinephrine is most likely to be effective if it is given early and after chest compressions have begun. 
The likelihood of meaningful survival declines after three (3) doses of epinephrine. Resuscitation 
should continue focused on quality CPR, defibrillation, and identifying reversible causes. Additional 
doses of epinephrine should only be administered with Base order. 
 
⓫ Potential causes that can be treated in the field include hypoxia, hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, 
hypothermia, toxins, and tension pneumothorax. Massive pulmonary embolism is a rare cause that 
may be treated with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). Hypoglycemia is a very 
rare cause of cardiac arrest and should not be assessed until after ROSC. If environmental 
hypothermia is suspected, resuscitation efforts should not be abandoned until the patient is re-
warmed, or after consultation with the Base Physician. 
 
   ⓬   Treat suspected hyperkalemia with calcium and sodium bicarbonate as soon as possible. The     
sooner it is administered, the more likely it is to be effective. Flush the line between medication 
administration. 
 
 ⓭   Approximately 40% of patients will re-arrest shortly after ROSC. Early indicators of impending re-
arrest include falling EtCO
2
 and progressive bradycardia. Anticipate this decline as the epinephrine 
administered during the resuscitation begins to lose effect. Fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, 
and avoidance of hyperventilation are recommended to decrease the risk of re-arrest.. These steps 
take approximately 5 minutes and should be initiated immediately after ROSC to stabilize the patient 
prior to transport to reduce chances of re-arrest en route.  
 
⓮ All cardiac arrest patients, with or without ROSC for whom the decision has been made to transport, 
shall be transported to an SRC if ground transport is 30 minutes or less, as initiation of targeted 
temperature management and early coronary angiography in a specialty center have been shown to 
improve outcomes.  
 
⓯ ETCO
2
 can help guide your ventilation rate; target ETCO
2
 35-45 mmHg. Just after ROSC, the ETCO
2
 
may be transiently elevated. This will decrease appropriately with ventilation and does not require 
hyperventilation to normalize. Persistently elevated ETCO
2
 and/or “sharkfin” waveform may indicate 
respiratory failure as cause of the cardiac arrest. Falsely low ETCO
2
 measurements can occur if 
there is a leak with BMV or shock. 
 
⓰ Push-dose Epinephrine is appropriate for non-traumatic shock including cardiogenic shock.  
Additional doses beyond 10mL may need to be prepared for prolonged transports.  
 
⓱ An ECG with STEMI after ROSC requires notification of ECG findings to the SRC. 
 
⓲ Narcotic overdose should be suspected in cases where there is drug paraphernalia on scene or there 
is a witness report.  Pinpoint pupils may be present, but hypoxia during cardiac arrest can cause 
mydriasis (dilated pupils) instead.  
 
⓳ EMS is assisting the Department of Public Health (DPH) in promptly investigating fatal or nonfatal 
drownings at public pools or spas in order to ensure safety can be verified before reopening. 
Contacting the on-call DPH officer will allow timely investigation of these incidents and prevent future 
incidents.

REVISED: 07-01-24 PAGE 39 OF 447 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶ Patients may have a myocardial infarction (MI) with or without ST elevations on the ECG. You should 
review and interpret the ECG; the software interpretation is not always accurate. Include your 
impression of the patient and interpretation of the ECG when discussing destination decision with the 
base. Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) require emergent treatment with 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the catheterization lab to improve survival, so they 
require field routing directly to a STEMI center (SRC). If artifact inhibits your ability to interpret the 
ECG, the software cannot read it either. ECGs of such poor quality as to inhibit interpretation should 
not be used to determine destination and should be repeated. 
 
❷ Obtain the ECG as soon as possible with initial vital signs. For patients in whom you have a high 
clinical suspicion for STEMI and the initial ECG does not meet STEMI criteria, you should repeat the 
ECG prior to transport and at any point that the patient’s clinical status changes. Repeating the ECG 
increases your chances of detecting an evolving STEMI. Consider repeating the ECG in cases where 
you have a low clinical suspicion and the initial ECG software interpretation is STEMI, particularly if 
there is artifact present that may affect the interpretation. 
 
❸ Aspirin is the most important medication for patients with acute myocardial infarction to improve 
outcomes and should be administered as soon as possible. All patients with cardiac chest pain 
should receive aspirin unless contraindicated due to active gastrointestinal bleeding or allergy, even if 
they already took aspirin at home or are prescribed anticoagulant medications. While there are other 
causes of chest pain that can present similarly to an MI, including aortic dissection, these causes are 
rare and the benefit of aspirin for patients with MI outweighs the risks of administration.   
 
❹  Nitroglycerin can cause a severe drop in blood pressure in some patients and, while useful for      
treatment of pain, it has not been shown to improve survival. Use caution in patients with borderline 
or relative hypotension (patients with history of hypertension or taking antihypertensive medications 
and SBP < 110) and/or patients with abnormal heart rate < 50 or > 120. It is acceptable to hold 
nitroglycerin in these patients. Inferior MI alone is not a contraindication to nitroglycerin. 
 
❺ Morphine or fentanyl is preferred for the treatment of cardiac chest pain that does not respond to 
nitroglycerin or when nitroglycerin is contraindicated: do not administer ketorolac. Morphine or 
fentanyl is also preferred over nitroglycerin to treat pain in patients with suspected aortic dissection. 
The classic presentation of acute aortic dissection is acute onset “tearing” chest pain radiating to the 
back. Other findings that raise concern for aortic dissection are chest pain associated with new focal 
neurologic abnormalities or with a difference in SBP of 20mmHg or more between arms. The primary 
treatment goal in the alert patient is to decrease heart rate by alleviating pain and anxiety. These 
patients are most often hypertensive. Treat hypotension only if SBP is < 90mmHg in both arms or if 
patient has other signs of poor perfusion.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶  Patients at increased risk for hyperkalemia include those with history or clinical evidence of renal 
failure, missed dialysis or patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone. ECG 
signs of hyperkalemia included peaked T-waves, wide QRS, bradycardia, long PR interval and 
absent P-waves. 
 
❷    Sodium Bicarbonate is another rapid-acting treatment for suspected hyperkalemia. Due to the risk of 
pulmonary edema, contact Base to discuss administration.  
 
❸ In patients with 2
nd
 degree type II or 3
rd
 degree heart block, atropine is unlikely to produce clinical 
improvement, therefore TCP should not be delayed for atropine administration. 
 
❹    Electrical capture can occur without mechanical capture. Assess for electrical capture by reviewing 
the rhythm strip for a QRS complex and a T wave after each pacer spike. Assess for mechanical 
capture by palpating a pulse with each QRS complex.  
 
❺ Push-dose Epinephrine is appropriate for non-traumatic shock including cardiogenic shock.  
Additional doses beyond 10mL may need to be prepared for prolonged transports. 
 
❻    Consider calcium channel blocker and beta blocker overdose in patients with bradycardia and 
hypotension. Ask about potential exposures including medications in the home. Hyperglycemia is a 
common finding with calcium channel blocker overdose.  
 
❼ Nausea and vomiting cause vagal stimulation, which can worsen bradycardia. Ondansetron may be 
administered to reduce potential for nausea or vomiting.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Treatment of sinus tachycardia should be directed at the underlying cause.  Sinus tachycardia due to 
conditions such as hypovolemia, sepsis, or GI bleed can present as a wide complex tachycardia in 
patients with left or right bundle branch blocks.  P waves should be visible before each QRS and a 
typical bundle branch block pattern noted on the ECG.  
 
❷   Tachycardia is often a response to an underlying illness including but not limited to: sepsis, GI 
bleeding, respiratory distress, anaphylaxis, hyperthermia, and toxic ingestions.  Sinus tachycardia 
may be a manifestation of pain and/or anxiety, but these should not be considered until other, more 
dangerous etiologies, are evaluated. 
 
❸    Sinus tachycardia can occur at a rate above 150 bpm. Sinus tachycardia does not respond to 
Adenosine, so it should not be administered, and treatment should be directed at the underlying 
cause.   
 
❹    Adenosine is contraindicated in patients with history of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome and 
atrial fibrillation, Sick Sinus Syndrome, or heart transplant; or if the patient’s medications include 
carbamazepine (Tegretol) for seizure disorder. In these patients, adenosine may cause degeneration 
to a fatal dysrhythmia. 
 
❺     Altered level of consciousness (ALOC) refers to a decrease or depressed level of consciousness 
compared to the patient’s baseline (secondary to shock or hypoperfusion. 
 
❻ Patients with atrial fibrillation (or flutter) have abnormal impulses generated by the atria. Adenosine is 
not effective to slow or terminate the rhythm and, in the presence of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) 
Syndrome, can cause ventricular fibrillation. Further, these rhythms cause abnormal contraction of 
the atria that can lead to clot formation. Cardioversion increases the risk for stroke as these clots can 
be forced out of the atria into circulation after cardioversion. Consider and treat underlying causes of 
rapid atrial fibrillation (e.g. dehydration, sepsis) prior to cardioversion. Cardioversion is appropriate for 
cases of acute onset (<48 hours) atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability and without other 
apparent cause. 
 
❼ Regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia may be supraventricular rhythm with a bundle 
branch block or aberrancy. In this case, Adenosine may convert the rhythm to sinus and AHA 
guidelines recommend its use for regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia. Adenosine should 
not be used for irregular wide complex tachycardia, because this may represent atrial fibrillation with 
WPW and lead to degeneration to a fatal dysrhythmia (see ❹ above).

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶ Fowler’s or Semi-Fowler’s positioning is likely to be most comfortable for awake patients with 
pulmonary edema. 
 
 
❷ Early use of CPAP has been shown to decrease hospital length of stay and risk of intubation for 
patients with pulmonary edema. Unless contraindicated, it should be initiated for all patients in 
moderate or severe respiratory distress from pulmonary edema regardless of SpO
2
. 
 
Contraindications: refer to MCG 1315 
 
❸   Cardiac ischemia should be suspected in patients complaining of chest pain or with new onset 
pulmonary edema without history of CHF/Heart failure. CHF is a common cause of ECG 
abnormalities that do not require transport to a SRC.  
 
❹ In patients with recent use of sexually enhancing drugs, or systolic murmur and pulmonary edema 
due to critical aortic stenosis, nitroglycerin may precipitate significant hypotension and cardiovascular 
collapse. If patient with systolic murmur on exam, consider discussion with Base Physician prior to 
NTG administration.  
 
❺  Sudden significant decreases in blood pressure may cause stroke symptoms in patients with 
previously uncontrolled hypertension. If blood pressure decreases > 40mmHg or patient develops 
neurologic abnormalities (stroke symptoms or ALOC) after nitroglycerin, hold additional doses. 
Reassess blood pressure after 5 minutes.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Any delivery after the first trimester (12 weeks) should be considered childbirth for the purposes of 
this treatment protocol and paramedics should contact Base to discuss the management and 
transport.  In general, delivery prior to 20 weeks gestation is nonviable and does not require 
resuscitation. However, dates can be incorrectly estimated, therefore, Base Contact is strongly 
encouraged.  Any potentially viable birth should be resuscitated in the field and transported to a 
perinatal center that is also an EDAP (with a NICU if ≤34 weeks gestation).  Births prior to 20 weeks 
do not necessarily require specialty center care and can be transported to the MAR. 
 
❷    Delay in clamping and cutting the cord for up 30 to 60 seconds is recommended unless newborn 
needs immediate resuscitation 
 
❸    Some bleeding is normal during delivery, typically up to 500mL. Bleeding is reduced with fundal 
massage after placental delivery, which promotes contraction of the uterus. Post-partum hemorrhage 
is defined as blood loss with signs of poor perfusion and/or cumulative blood loss ≥1000mL.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    This protocol was intended for complications of pregnancy at the time of delivery; if patient is known       
to be pregnant and has complaints not associated with labor or delivery treat per TP 1202, General 
Medical or most applicable protocol. 
 
❷    If the patient has vaginal bleeding associated with known pregnancy > 20 weeks, Contact Base and 
communicate signs and symptoms so that the receiving hospital can pre-notify OB consultants as 
needed. 
 
❸   Any delivery after the first trimester (12 weeks) should be considered childbirth for the purposes of 
this treatment protocol and paramedics should contact Base to discuss the management and 
transport. In general, delivery prior to 20 weeks gestation is nonviable and does not require 
resuscitation. However, dates can be incorrectly estimated, therefore, Base Contact is strongly 
encouraged. Any potentially viable birth should be resuscitated in the field and transported to a 
perinatal center that is also an EDAP (with a NICU if ≤34 weeks gestation). Births prior to 20 weeks 
do not necessarily require specialty center care and can be transported to the MAR. 
 
❹  In addition to manually elevating the presenting part from the umbilical cord, placing the patient in 
Trendelenburg position during transport can help to elevate the presenting part off the cord to 
maintain blood flow to the fetus. Do not attempt to push a prolapsed cord back in. 
 
❺    Shoulder dystocia is inability to deliver the anterior shoulder, which usually occurs in large newborns. 
If delivery fails to progress after head delivers, hyperflex mother’s hips tightly in knee to chest 
position (McRoberts maneuver) and apply firm suprapubic pressure in attempt to dislodge anterior 
shoulder.  
 
❻    HTN in a pregnant or recently post-partum patient is a sign of pre-eclampsia, which required 
immediate emergency and obstetric care. Additional signs of pre-eclampsia are edema and 
headache which can progress to seizures (eclampsia). Patients who are  ≥ 20 weeks pregnant or ≤ 6 
weeks post-partum with hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90mmHg) should be transported to a Perinatal 
Center for evaluation. 
 
❼    Some bleeding is normal during delivery, typically up to 500mL. Bleeding is reduced with fundal 
massage after placental delivery, which promotes contraction of the uterus. Post-partum hemorrhage 
is typically defined as blood loss with signs of poor perfusion and/or cumulative blood loss 
≥1000mLs, however, if despite fundal massage the estimated blood loss is > 500 mLs and there is 
ongoing hemorrhage, initiate TXA and fluids concurrently.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶    Do not touch the patient unless you have removed the source of the electricity. An electrical current 
can be conducted through water and skin. Ensure that area surrounding the patient is dry before 
approaching him/her.  
 
 
 ❷   For young, healthy patients, especially in lightning injuries, consider prolonged cardio-pulmonary 
resuscitation.  
 
❸    Electrocution may result in ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole or other 
dysrhythmias. However, if the patient is in a regular rhythm on evaluation, they are unlikely to 
develop a dysrhythmia. 
 
❹    Superficial skin findings do not correlate with the severity of an electrical burn. As the electrical 
current passes through tissue, it can cause more damage than is superficially present.

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Cardiac arrest from drowning should be treated per TP 1210, Cardiac Arrest. Ventilation is 
particularly important as the cardiac arrest is almost always due to respiratory failure. In cases of 
cold water drowning follow usual protocols for resuscitation while simultaneously rewarming the 
patient. Patients with hypothermia due to cold water drowning, may have good neurologic outcome 
despite prolonged resuscitation; resuscitative efforts should continue until the patient is rewarmed.  
Consultation with the Base Physician is required before consideration of termination of resuscitation 
in patients with suspected hypothermia. 
 
❷   Decompression illness includes arterial gas embolism from barotrauma and decompression   
sickness (aka “the bends”) due to dissolved nitrogen in the blood coming out of solution.  
Decompression illness most frequently occurs in scuba divers after breathing compressed air at 
depth. While arterial gas embolism presents almost immediately after ascent, decompression 
sickness is often delayed and should be considered in any patient with symptoms (e.g. respiratory 
distress, ALOC, chest or body pain) within 24 hours of completing a dive. All patients with possible 
decompression illness need immediate evaluation for possible hyperbaric treatment.  Per Ref. 518, 
contact Base immediately to discuss. 
 
❸    Warming measures should include moving the patient to a warm environment as quickly as 
possible, removing wet clothing/items, covering with an emergency/rescue blanket or other 
blankets/sheets, and using warm Normal Saline if available.  
 
❹  Rales may be present in patients after submersion/drowning due to direct lung injury and/or 
aspiration of water. This is not an indication of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (such as from 
congestive heart failure) and does not prohibit administration of IV fluids. IV fluids should be initiated 
and continued unless respiratory status worsens during administration. 
 
❺ EMS is assisting the Department of Public Health (DPH) in promptly investigating fatal or nonfatal 
drownings at public pools or spas in order to ensure safety can be verified before reopening. 
Contacting the on-call DPH officer will allow timely investigation of these incidents and prevent 
future incidents.

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Dizziness is often used to describe two different feelings; vertigo and lightheadedness. Vertigo is the 
sensation of a person or their surroundings moving when no actual movement is occurring.  People 
often describe the feeling of spinning, falling, tilting, or being off balance. This is often associated with 
nausea/vomiting. Lightheadedness can lead to feeling faint or syncope, and the patient often reports 
improvement with supine position.  
 
❷   Using a stroke scale, such as mLAPSS, increases the chances of diagnosing a stroke. However, 
stroke scales do not identify all strokes.  Vertigo may be a symptom of a cerebellar stroke. If patient’s 
coordination or gait is abnormal with complaint of vertigo, strongly consider stroke. 
 
❸   Last known well time (LKWT) determines the patient’s eligibility for TPA and/or interventional 
procedures for clot removal.  Document the name and contact information of the family member, 
caregiver, or witness who can verify the patient’s LKWT and report this information to ED providers. If 
possible, transport the witness with the patient.

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶   If LAMS is 4 or greater, place 18 gauge IV if possible to facilitate advanced imaging studies at CSC. 
 
❷ The Modified LAPSS (mLAPSS) is a validated tool that helps to identify stroke mimics and excludes 
patients that will not benefit from stroke care. Using a stroke scale, such as mLAPSS, increases the 
chances of diagnosing strokes. However, stroke scales do not catch all strokes, including 
presentations such as aphasia, ataxia and vertigo. For patients in whom you suspect stroke but are 
mLAPSS negative, calculate the LAMS and contact the Base to discuss the destination decision. 
History of prior stroke does not exclude the need to evaluate for possible new deficits. New findings 
in a patient with prior stroke should be managed similarly to first-time strokes and such patients 
should be routed to the closest appropriate approved stroke center per Ref. 521. 
 
❸  In patients with suspected stroke, the LAMS is performed by verbally requesting movement of face,    
     arm, and grip or, if the patient is aphasic, by non-verbally encouraging such movement via pantomime   
     and/or by gentle placement of limbs (painful stimulation is avoided). In patients with suspected stroke  
     with ALOC (e.g., GCS <9) attempt neurologic assessment as noted above; alternatively, for patients 
unable to perform movements, compare tone and strength through passive movement of the limbs.  
 
❹ LKWT determines the patient’s eligibility for TPA and/or interventional procedures for clot removal.  
Document the name and contact information of the family member, caregiver, or witness who can 
verify the patient’s LKWT and report this information to ED providers. If possible, transport the 
witness with the patient. 
 
❺   Whenever possible transport patients with suspected stroke with head of bed elevated 30-45 
degrees. This reduces risk of aspiration and also reduces elevation in intracranial pressure.

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Patients who are lightheaded and/or tachycardic when sitting and/or standing compared to lying 
down, referred to as orthostatic, are likely dehydrated and in need for fluid resuscitation. Orthostatic 
vital signs provide little information and may result in harm so should not be performed. Syncope can 
result from a lack of adequate perfusion to the brain, and in the setting of suspected dehydration or 
fluid losses, this can be a sign of poor perfusion. Therefore, for patients who present with syncope 
with orthostasis and/or dehydration, fluid resuscitation is appropriate unless contraindicated. Use 
caution in patients with history or congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency. 
 
❷   In a female with syncope, ask about possible pregnancy and any history of vaginal bleeding.  One   
cause of syncope in females is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This can be life threatening and may 
present with poor perfusion and require fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline. Alert Base if patient 
known to be pregnant. 
 
❸    Elderly patients should be evaluated carefully for traumatic injuries resulting from ground level falls.  
Common injuries include blunt head trauma and extremity fractures.

obturator obstructs airflow and is only used during insertion. The inner cannula allows for connection 
to a ventilator or bag mask for positive pressure ventilation. There are both cuffed and uncuffed 
tracheostomy tubes. If the tracheostomy does not have a cuff (balloon inflated in the trachea 
indicated by a side port), the airway is not protected against aspiration and air can leak out through 
the mouth during positive-pressure ventilation. If respiratory failure occurs in a patient with an 
uncuffed tracheostomy tube, it should be replaced with a cuffed endotracheal tube if feasible in order 
to facilitate positive-pressure ventilation. For bleeding direct pressure should be applied and 
suctioning as needed to reduce aspiration of blood. 
 
❹  The inner cannula is required to attach a ventilator or bag mask to a tracheostomy for positive-
pressure ventilation. It may become obstructed with secretions; remove, clean with saline, and 
replace once obstruction relieved.  
 
❺   Removal and reinsertion of the tracheostomy tube is contraindicated if the tracheostomy is < 1 week 
old because the stoma has not fully formed and a false tract may be created. Once the stoma has 
matured, a tracheostomy can be safely removed and replaced when necessary. If a flexible 
intubation guide (e.g., Bougie) can be inserted, it may be used to guide the removal and reinsertion 
of the tracheostomy or endotracheal tube.

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶   Consider wearing surgical mask when caring for patients with respiratory distress of unclear etiology, 
which may be infectious. 
 
❷   Initiate BMV to assess patient response. Effective BMV may improve the patient’s respiratory status 
enough to restore adequate spontaneous respirations. Place advanced airway placement if BMV is 
ineffective or consider placement once assessment for rapidly reversible causes is complete. 
Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, circumstances, and skill level 
when selecting the advanced airway modality. 
 
❸    If positive pressure ventilation is performed at any time, document Provider Impression as 
Respiratory Arrest / Respiratory Failure. 
 
❹    Fowler’s or Semi-Fowler’s positioning is likely to be most comfortable for awake patients with  
      respiratory distress. 
 
❺ Early use of CPAP has been shown to decrease ICU length of stay and risk of intubation for patients 
with severe respiratory distress. It should be strongly considered for patients in moderate-to-severe 
respiratory distress, based on assessment of work of breathing, regardless of SpO
2
. 
 
CPAP is appropriate for undifferentiated respiratory distress. It is the treatment of choice for patients 
with COPD exacerbation and may be used in conjunction with albuterol or if patient does not improve 
after initial albuterol.  
 
❻ Persistently high or increasing end-tidal CO
2
 (EtCO
2
) readings above normal in a spontaneously 
ventilating patient with reduced respiratory rate indicates bradypneic hypoventilation; whereas low 
EtCO
2
 readings with a slow respiratory rate represents hypopneic hypoventilation; consider the need 
for assisted ventilation in these cases. In a patient with respiratory distress of unclear etiology, a 
“shark-fin” capnography waveform indicates likely Bronchospasm/COPD exacerbation. Gradually 
elevating EtCO
2
 waveforms (“stacking”) in a patient with BMV indicates excessive ventilation by the 
provider, resulting in inadequate exhalation; in this case, decrease ventilation rate significantly to 
avoid progression to cardiopulmonary arrest. 
 
❼ Wheezing may also be caused by pulmonary edema; reassess breath sounds frequently for patients 
without history of asthma or with other concerns for volume overload (edema, etc.), because as air 
entry improves with treatment, rales may be more easily heard.  If pulmonary edema/CHF 
exacerbation suspected, treat per TP 1214, Pulmonary Edema/CHF. 
 
❽ Administration of albuterol via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer is considered equivalent to 
nebulized albuterol; a spacer is typically required for this route to be effective in novice users. MDIs 
are single use and should be left with the hospital staff upon handoff of the patient. 
 
❾ Epinephrine may be administered prior to albuterol as initial drug therapy in patients with Respiratory 
Failure due to bronchospasm.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, altered level of consciousness, malaise, 
nausea, dizziness and unresponsiveness. Consider carbon monoxide when multiple persons in same 
location present with any of these symptoms. 
 
❷    Patients with carbon monoxide poisoning have impaired oxygen delivery and are at high risk for 
cardiac ischemia. 
   
❸    The measured CO level should not impact the transport decision. It will be helpful for hospital 
treatment of the exposure. 
 
❹    Exposures to certain chemicals can be associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. For example, 
methylene chloride (dichloromethane) is an industrial solvent and a component of paint remover. It is 
metabolized to carbon monoxide by the liver and may cause carbon monoxide toxicity if inhaled or 
ingested.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶  The first priority for apneic patients after narcotic overdose is to begin positive pressure ventilation.  
Once ventilations are established, naloxone should be administered with the goal of restoring 
spontaneous ventilations.  Vascular access should not take priority over initial treatment with 
Naloxone (IN or IM) for patients with suspected opiate overdose. Patients who are awake and alert 
with normal respirations after naloxone therapy may not require IV access or additional doses of 
naloxone.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Crush syndrome is a systemic illness characterized by dysrhythmias and shock. It results from toxins 
released from crushed muscle tissue into the blood stream. Patients are at risk for crush syndrome if 
they have all of the following: 1) circumferential compression causing crush injury; AND 2) 
involvement of a large muscle group (lower extremity including the thigh(s) and/or pelvic girdle or 
upper extremity including the pectoral girdle); AND 3) entrapment for at least 1 hour. The risk of 
crush syndrome increases with the amount of muscle involved and the duration of the entrapment.   
 
❷    For patients requiring transport to a Trauma Center per Ref. 506, contact the receiving Trauma 
Center for Base Medical Direction and notification. If the Base Hospital is contacted and the Base 
redirects transport to a Trauma Center, Base personnel will notify the Trauma Center. 
 
❸    A backboard is not required for spinal motion restriction (SMR) and may cause harm as well as 
increased pain. Patients should not be transported on a backboard for the purpose of SMR. If a 
backboard is used for extrication, patients who are alert should then be logrolled onto the gurney 
prior to transport. The backboard may be used during patient transport for splinting of multiple 
simultaneous extremity fractures or to assist with maneuvering the unconscious patient. In all cases, 
the backboard should be removed immediately if causing respiratory compromise.   
 
❹    Patients with significant crush injury at risk for crush syndrome require large volumes of fluid 
resuscitation. Patients with prolonged entrapment will require maintenance fluids.  IO access should 
be considered when attempts at IV access are not successful if: 1) prolonged entrapment is likely (> 
30 minutes) and/or 2) there are signs of hyperkalemia and/or 3) there is risk of crush syndrome 
requiring medication administration. 
 
❺    Flush the IV line with normal saline after each medication. Administration of Calcium and Bicarbonate 
together will cause precipitation of the medication. 
 
❻   The duration of action of the medications is approximately 30 minutes. Contact Base to discuss re- 
dosing the medications if persistent signs of hyperkalemia or if the patient will not arrive at the 
hospital within 30 minutes. 
 
❼    These medications should be administered prior to release of the compressive force to prevent 
complications from the cellular toxins that enter the circulation upon extrication of the patient.  
Calcium stabilizes the cardiac muscle and should be administered first.   
 
❽   Tourniquet placement PRIOR to extrication is a last resort for patients who are at risk for crush 
syndrome in whom vascular access cannot be established or when transport time is anticipated to be 
> 30 minutes. The tourniquet must completely occlude venous and arterial flow in order to protect the 
patient from crush syndrome. Establish vascular access and cardiac monitoring immediately after 
extrication and be prepared to treat symptoms of crush syndrome. 
 
❾ In patients meeting an indication for TXA, administer fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline and TXA 
concurrently.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶     Rapid transport after hemorrhage control is the priority for all patients with severe trauma. With the 
exception of hemorrhage control, needle thoracostomy, and initiation of CPR, all other procedures 
may be deferred for immediate ambulance loading of patient and performed en route. 
 
❷    Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with a viral filter is the preferred initial method of airway management. 
An advanced airway may be placed during transport or if BMV is difficult or ineffective. Supraglottic 
airway is preferred unless contraindicated. Paramedics should use judgment based on patient 
characteristics, circumstances, and skill level when selecting the advanced airway modality. 
 
❸  Patients with penetrating trauma should receive defibrillation while still prioritizing early transport. 
 
❹     Patients in cardiac arrest with hanging or submersion mechanisms are asphyxial in the large 
majority of cases and should be considered a medical cardiac arrest, and therefore managed in 
accordance with TP-1210-Cardiac Arrest with transport destination per Ref. No. 516. Trauma center 
destination in cases with ROSC should only be considered if there is strong evidence of cervical 
spine injury. 
 
❺      Sudden cardiac death can result from blunt cardiac injury (commotio cordis) triggering V-fib/V-tach.  
Unlike major trauma resulting in hemorrhagic shock, patients with this mechanism typically have 
minimal external trauma and should be treated with immediate defibrillation on scene.  Patients 
with multisystem blunt trauma in persistent cardiac arrest without organized rhythm should generally 
not be transported.  If commotio cordis is the suspected mechanism with minimal external trauma 
and the patient remains in V-fib/V-tach after three defibrillations, contact Base to discuss timing of 
transport versus termination for futility. 
 
❻  For patients in traumatic arrest, spinal motion restriction (SMR) using a backboard causes harmful 
delays in care. However, a backboard may be helpful to assist in patient movement and to support 
chest compressions.

simultaneous extremity fractures or to assist in maneuvering the unconscious patient. In all cases, 
the backboard should be removed immediately if causing respiratory compromise.   
 
❹  Traumatic events may be due to a medical emergency, particularly single-vehicle accidents and 
unexplained falls. 
 
❺    Placement of a vented dressing can prevent conversion of an open pneumothorax to a tension 
pneumothorax. However, tension pneumothorax may still develop in the presence of a vented 
dressing and should be treated with needle thoracostomy. Furthermore, needle thoracostomy in a 
patient with evidence of tension pneumothorax should not be delayed for placement of dressing. 
 
❻    Aggressive fluid resuscitation increases vascular pressure and dilutes clotting factors, which may 
increase internal bleeding.   
• In patients with blunt trauma and poor perfusion: administer fluids to target SBP ≥ 90mmHg.  
• In patients with penetrating trauma and poor perfusion: administer fluids to target SBP ≥ 70mmHg if 
patient has normal mental status (permissive hypotension).  Patients with ALOC or SBP < 
70mmHg should receive fluids until their mental status and SBP improve.   
• In patients with possible traumatic brain injury: permissive hypotension is contraindicated and SBP 
should be maintained ≥ 90mmHg. 
 
❼   In patients meeting an indication for TXA, administer fluid resuscitation with normal saline and TXA    
     concurrently. 
 
❽  Vomiting should be prevented and/or immediately treated in patients with head injury, since it 
increases intra-cranial pressure and can compromise the patient’s airway. 
 
❾   Traumatic brain injury presents with altered mental status after head injury.  Any hypoxic episode, 
even brief, is associated with worse patient outcome for patients with traumatic brain injury. 
 
❿ Hyperventilation reduces blood flow to the brain by reducing CO
2
 and is associated with worse 
outcomes in severe head injuries. Ventilate to maintain an ETCO2 in the range 35-45mmHg.   
 
⓫    Any hypotension increases mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. Normal Saline should be 
initiated to maintain SBP ≥ 90mmHg at all times but can be withheld if the blood pressure is elevated.

⓬    A head-elevated position at about 30 degrees reduces intra-cranial pressure and improves 
respiratory status. Patients in a cervical collar may have their head elevated if there is no concern for 
thoracic or lumbar spine injury. Reverse Trendelenburg is another option for patients that cannot be 
seated. Patients who are hypotensive should be maintained supine unless airway compromise 
requires repositioning.   
 
⓭ Open femur fracture is not a contraindication to apply the traction splint. If the bone is protruding and 
there is gross contamination, wash with saline prior to applying the splint. 
 
⓮    If the amputated part is available, similar care should be taken to rinse off any gross debris, wrap the 
part with saline-moistened sterile gauze, seal in plastic and place indirectly on ice after wrapping; do 
not submerge in water or place directly on ice.  Transport the amputated part with the patient and 
leave it with hospital staff.

❶   In pediatric patients with hypoglycemia consider causes such as medication error or medication given 
without appropriate oral intake, infection, or toxins. Survey scene and ask family for types of 
medications in the home including those in various forms (e.g., pill, patch, drops, salves, inhaled or 
herbal). Caretakers of pediatric patients should always be encouraged to have patient be transported 
to the hospital for evaluation as hypoglycemia in this population is rare as compared to adults and is 
often caused by serious disease or poisonings.  
 
❷ Use judgment based on the clinical status of the patient to determine whether IO placement for 
dextrose and/or fluid administration prior to hospital arrival is warranted.  For altered patients who 
show signs of shock/poor perfusion and/or extremis with severe HYPERglycemia or HYPOglycemia 
and an IV cannot be obtained, an IO may be placed for fluid resuscitation or treatment with dextrose. 
Refer to MCG 1375.    
 
❸    Pediatric patients with hypoglycemia who are successfully treated with oral glucose or Dextrose 10% 
IV and then their parent wishes to decline transport to the hospital should be discouraged to do so, 
especially if they have abnormal vital signs, fever, are taking long acting hypoglycemic agents 
possible ingestion or poisoning, or if they DO NOT have a history of diabetes mellitus as these 
patients are at high risk for recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.  
 
Long Acting hypoglycemic agents 
• Sulfonylureas: gliclazide, glimepiride, glipizide, gliquidone, glyburide, glyclopyramide,  
• Thiazolidinediones (TZDs): pioglitazone (Actos), rosiglitazone (Avandia), troglitazone 
(Rezulin) 
• Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: acarbose, miglitol, voglibose 
• Meglitinides – nateglinide, repaglinide 
• Combination drugs: glipizide and metformin (Metaglip), glyburide and metformin 
(Glucovance), pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact), pioglitazone and metformin (ACTOplus  
• Met), rosiglitazone and metformin (Avandamet), rosiglitazone and glimepiride (Avandaryl) 
 
 
 ❹   Glucagon is effective only if there are sufficient glycogen stores in the liver. Patients with low   
glycogen stores such as young infant, severe malnutrition, cirrhosis, or adrenal insufficiency may not  
respond to glucagon.  
 
❺       Patients with hyperglycemia are at risk for significant volume losses leading to dehydration and 
electrolyte abnormalities. Fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline is recommended until their glucose 
can be lowered with medications. Hyperglycemia can also be associated with trauma, infection, or 
other serious illness. For patients with elevated glucose requiring fluids IV Normal Saline should be 
given – only those patients who show signs of poor perfusion and an IV cannot be obtained would 
have an IO placed for fluid resuscitation.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Sepsis is defined as the body’s response to infection and may include fever, tachycardia or 
bradycardia, tachypnea, and signs of poor perfusion. Other signs of infection may be present such as 
cough (e.g., pneumonia), painful urination (e.g., urinary tract infection), abdominal pain                 
(e.g., appendicitis), headache (e.g., meningitis), or a red swollen extremity (e.g., cellulitis, or 
necrotizing fasciitis). Septic shock is a continuum of signs and symptoms which includes the 
presence of hypotension or evidence of poor perfusion. If infection is present and sepsis with or 
without shock is present document provider impression as Sepsis. 
 
❷    Fever is a natural response of the body to fight infection and may be present without signs of sepsis.  
Often children with a fever have tachycardia, however if tachycardia is greater than that explained by 
the fever (>180 in infants and >140 in children) consider sepsis. If fever is present without signs of 
sepsis (skin hot to touch and tachycardia) or septic shock (signs of poor perfusion), document the 
provider impression as Fever. 
 
❸   For patients presenting with fever, obtain travel history, and if travel history positive contact the 
Medical Alert Center to determine risk for infectious disease requiring special isolation procedures or 
transport. 
 
❹    Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body 
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat. Infants with sepsis may present with fever 
or hypothermia.

❶   Most patients with an inserted medical device have medical complaints that are not related to the 
device itself and should be treated as per standard protocols based on presenting signs and 
symptoms. It is important to obtain a history of when the medical device was inserted as different 
complications occur depending on time since insertion. 
❷   Patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts can have breakage of the shunt connections, obstruction, or 
infection of the shunt, which may present as ALOC, headache, nausea and vomiting, or fever. History 
should include last shunt revision date as shunt infections are most likely if a shunt revision is recent.

REVISED: 10-01-24 PAGE 125 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Shock is inadequate tissue perfusion, equivalent to poor perfusion for the purposes of this protocol. 
Consider Base Hospital Contact if hypotension/shock of unclear etiology.  Use caution if the patient 
has known cyanotic congenital heart disease. Newborns requiring positive-pressure ventilation 
should receive 90 seconds of room air, and then start oxygen 15L/min if heart rate remains < 100 
beats per minute and/or persistent shock. 
 
❷    Maintaining a patient supine improves perfusion to vital organs; raising the lower limbs does not 
provide additional benefit. However, not all patients will tolerate a supine position, which can further 
compromise respiratory function and airway patency.  
 
❸ Peripheral venous access may be difficult to obtain in infants and small children. Consider IO 
placement as primary vascular access in extremis patients for whom venous access is unlikely to be 
achieved rapidly. For older children, make two attempts at venous access and, if unsuccessful, place 
an IO for vascular access.   
 
❹ Exposure to cold increases the likelihood of bleeding complications. 
 
❺  There are many etiologies of shock. The treatment protocols referenced here contain guidance on 
specific interventions beyond what is contained in this treatment protocol. The level of systolic blood 
pressure varies by age and thresholds for hypotension are found in MCG 1309 and can be used in 
decisions for fluid resuscitation. Hypotension is a late finding in pediatric shock; fluid resuscitation 
should be guided by clinical evidence of poor perfusion (MCG 1355). Consider Base Hospital Contact 
if hypotension/shock of unclear etiology. 
❻    Push-dose Epinephrine is appropriate for non-traumatic shock including cardiogenic shock. 
Additional doses beyond 10mL may need to be prepared for prolonged transports. For patients < 
10kg, transfer the diluted Push-dose Epinephrine to a smaller (1mL or 3mL) syringe in order to 
administer the dose accurately.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶ Scene safety includes the assessment for the presence of firearms or weapons, including 
observations and direct inquiry with the patient and any available/relevant third parties (e.g., family, 
caregivers, or witnesses). If a weapon is found on the scene, EMS personnel should notify all 
members on the scene, and contact law enforcement (LE) immediately.  
  
❷    Psychiatric, including mental health and substance abuse, emergencies are medical emergencies, 
and as such are best treated by EMS personnel. Those patients with psychiatric emergencies 
presenting with agitation, violence, threats of harm to self or others, or criminal activity are best 
managed by an EMS and LE co-response. 
 
❸ Always attempt verbal de-escalation first and avoid applying restraints to patients who do not present 
a threat to self or EMS personnel (Ref. 838, Application of Patients Restraints) 
 
❹    Many medical causes of psychiatric symptoms exist: 
Agitation (see MCG 1307) 
Acute pain 
Head trauma 
Infection 
Encephalitis or Encephalopathy 
Exposure to environmental toxins 
Metabolic derangement 
Hypoxia 
Thyroid disease or other hormone irregularity

❺   Medications used for pharmacologic management of agitation may cause respiratory depression;   
     administer only when necessary for the safety of the patients and/or EMS personnel. Apnea can 
occur suddenly and with little warning. Resuscitation equipment (oxygen and bag-mask ventilator) 
should be positioned near the patient and readily available prior to sedation. Every individual who 
receives restraint and/or midazolam pharmacologic management should be continuously monitored 
and transported for additional clinical assessment and treatment.     
 
❻   Use of restraints in severely agitated patients is associated with an increased risk of sudden death. 
Avoid using restraints in patients who do not present a threat to self or to EMS personnel. Monitor 
patients closely when restraints are applied. Never secure or transport a patient in restraints in prone 
position. 
 
❼   The IM or IN route is preferred unless an IV has been previously established. 
 
❽  Patients who are agitated while in physical restraint and have the potential for injury due to the 
      degree of agitation, should receive medication by EMS personnel to reduce 
      agitation with continued monitoring for respiratory depression, in accordance with Ref 838, 
      Application of Patient Restraints. 
 
 ❾  Several drugs that may cause agitation and present similarly to a psychiatric crisis may also cause 
life threatening cardiac arrhythmias after intentional or accidental overdose. These arrhythmias are 
often preceded by prolonged QRS intervals (> 0.12 sec) or bradycardia. Cocaine intoxication is 
strongly associated with severe agitation and may also produce cardiac effects similar to Tricyclic 
antidepressant (TCA) overdose (widened QRS progressing to malignant arrhythmia). These patients 
may require a large dose of sodium bicarbonate to prevent sudden cardiac death. Consult Base 
Physician immediately to discussion administration of Sodium Bicarbonate; may repeat x1 if QRS 
remains > 0.12 sec after initial sodium bicarbonate. Treat in conjunction with TP 1241-P, Overdose / 
Poisoning / Ingestion 
 
❿  Agitation may be present after a seizure, or in the setting of hypo/hyperglycemia. Consider checking   
     glucose early if the patient is a known diabetic or demonstrates clinical evidence of hypoglycemia, but  
     only if safe to do so. 
 
⓫  It is important to assess for any evidence of suicide attempt.  If there is concern for overdose, ask the 
patient or bystanders to provide information on agents used (specifically what, when, and how much). 
Collect and transport any medication vials, or additional pills). This will assist in determining 
necessary antidote treatment and monitoring at the hospital. This information is often lost, if not 
obtained immediately on scene. 
 
⓬   Patients with acute mental health or substance abuse crises may not be capable or willing to provide  
     reliable information, therefore, it is important to obtain third party collateral information about the  
     patient’s condition (e.g., from family, caregivers, witnesses), including names and contact information 
     for persons knowledgeable about the patient’s illness, treatment and medications.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶ EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
 when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to accepting 
ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkept home, evidence of drug 
or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or suspected domestic violence), when the history 
does not match with the severity of physical findings (e.g., child posturing after a roll off the couch), 
when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, whip marks on the 
skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. Children < 3 years 
of age and those with developmental delay are at increased risk of abuse. This must also be 
accompanied by notification to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). 
 
❷    Maintaining perfusion with high-quality CPR throughout resuscitation is essential to ensuring 
      good patient outcome. Chest compressions are the most important aspect of cardiac arrest  
      resuscitation. Maintaining chest compressions should take priority over any medication  
      administration or transport. Transporting the patient in cardiac arrest causes interruptions in CPR and  
      reduces CPR quality. Similar to adults in OHCA, pediatric patients who are resuscitated on scene  
      have higher neurologically intact survival. Transport may be initiated sooner if scene safety concerns. 
 
❸  Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with a viral filter is the preferred initial method of airway management for 
pediatric patients.  BMV in cardiac arrest has been associated with improved patient outcomes; the 
role of the supraglottic airway (SGA) in pediatric patients is still unknown. SGA placement should be 
performed if BMV is ineffective and otherwise deferred until initial resuscitation priorities are complete 
(i.e., at least 2 defibrillations for shockable rhythms and first dose of epinephrine IV for nonshockable 
rhythms). Sizing of the SGA per MCG 1309. When authorized, intubation should not be performed 
until after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) unless ventilation with BMV and SGA is 
ineffective and/or contraindicated. 
 
❹    Hyperventilation reduces venous return and worsens patient outcomes. Both continuous and 
interrupted (15:2) compressions/ventilations are acceptable. Regardless of ventilation method used, 
ventilations should be no more frequent than 10 per minute with a volume just enough to see chest 
rise and then release the bag to allow for exhalation (“squeeze, release, release”). Once ROSC is 
achieved ventilation rates can increase to 20 per minute.  
 
❺ Children < 3 years of age are at high risk for foreign body aspiration. Foreign body aspiration should 
be suspected if there is a history of possible aspiration or when there is no chest rise with BMV after 
repositioning of the airway.  
 
❻     EMS personnel should remain on scene up to 20 minutes to establish chest compressions, vascular 
access and epinephrine administration for nonshockable rhythms or until return of spontaneous 
circulation (ROSC) is achieved; for shockable rhythms, remain on scene until 3 defibrillations or until 
ROSC is achieved. The best results occur when resuscitation is initiated and maintained on scene, 
and post ROSC care is initiated. 
 
❼ If you are able to observe the underlying rhythm during compressions via rhythm display technology, 
do not pause for the rhythm check.

❽    ETCO
2
 should be > 10 with a “box-shaped” waveform during effective CPR. A flat or wavy waveform  
or ETCO
2
 < 10 may indicate ineffective compressions or airway obstruction. A sudden increase in 
ETCO
2
 is suggestive of ROSC. The waveform can also be used to confirm ventilation rate if an 
advanced airway or asynchronous ventilation with continuous compressions is used.  
 
❾    Peripheral venous access may be difficult to obtain in infants and small children. Consider IO 
placement as primary vascular access in patients for whom venous access is unlikely to be achieved 
rapidly. For older children, make two attempts at venous access and, if unsuccessful, place and IO 
for vascular access. 
 
❿ Epinephrine may improve outcomes if given early in nonshockable rhythms and should be given 
within 5 minutes of the resuscitation. For shockable rhythms, where defibrillation is the preferred 
initial treatment, epinephrine should be given after the second defibrillation. Epinephrine is most likely 
to be effective if it is given early and after chest compressions have begun. The likelihood of 
meaningful survival declines after three (3) doses of epinephrine.  Resuscitation should continue 
focused on quality CPR, defibrillation, and identifying reversible causes. Additional doses of 
epinephrine should only be administered with Base order if indicated, based on the individual patient.  
 
⓫ Potential causes that can be treated in the field include hypoxia, hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, 
hypothermia, toxins, and tension pneumothorax. Hypoxia and Hypovolemia are common causes of 
PEA arrest in children. Hypoglycemia is a very rare cause of cardiac arrest and should not be 
assessed until after ROSC.  
 
⓬   Changing the pad position, called vector change, from anterior-lateral to anterior-posterior or vice 
versa in patients who do not respond to initial defibrillation attempts, increases the chances of 
converting to a perfusing rhythm. 
 
⓭ Re-arrest shortly after ROSC is common. Early indicators of impending re-arrest include falling EtCO
2
 
and progressive bradycardia. Initiate post-resuscitation care prior to transport, if the scene allows, in 
order to reduce chances of re-arrest en route. Fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and 
avoidance of hyperventilation are recommended to decrease the risk of re-arrest. Transport 
considerations include suspected cause of arrest and anticipated transport time to a Pediatric 
Medical Center. Pediatric patients with ROSC should be transported to a Pediatric Medical Center if 
within 30 minutes. 
 
⓮    ETCO
2
 can help guide your ventilation rate; target ETCO
2
 35-45 mmHg. Just after ROSC, the ETCO
2
 
may be transiently elevated. This will decrease appropriately with ventilation and does not require 
hyperventilation to normalize. Persistently elevated ETCO
2
 and/or “sharkfin” waveform may indicate 
respiratory failure as cause of the cardiac arrest. Falsely low ETCO
2
 measurements can occur if 
there is a leak with BMV or shock. 
 
⓯ Push-dose Epinephrine is appropriate for non-traumatic shock including cardiogenic shock.  
Additional doses beyond 10mL may need to be prepared for prolonged transports. For patients          
< 10kg, transfer the diluted Push-dose Epinephrine to a smaller (1mL or 3mL) syringe in order to 
administer the dose accurately.   
 
⓰  Consider SGA placement if needed to facilitate effective ventilations during transport. In patients 
longer than the length-based resuscitation tape (e.g., Broselow tape) for whom intubation is also in

scope of practice, SGAs are the preferred advanced airway unless specifically contraindicated.  
 Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, circumstances, and skill level 
when selecting the advanced airway modality for pediatric patients in whom multiple modalities are 
authorized. 
 
⓱  Narcotic overdose should be suspected in cases where there is drug paraphernalia on scene or there 
is a witness report. Pinpoint pupils may be present, but hypoxia during cardiac arrest more often 
causes mydriasis (dilated pupils) instead. 
 
⓲ EMS is assisting the Department of Public Health (DPH) in promptly investigating fatal or nonfatal 
drownings at public pools or spas in order to ensure safety can be verified before reopening. 
Contacting the on-call DPH officer will allow timely investigation of these incidents and prevent future 
incidents.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶  Management of oxygenation and ventilation is the most important aspect of treatment of bradycardia 
in children. Squeeze the bag mask device just until chest rise is initiated and then release; state 
“Squeeze, Release, Release” to prevent hyperventilation. Young athletes, typically adolescents may 
have normal resting heart rates < 60 bpm, treat only if signs of poor perfusion. 
 
❷  For pediatric patients with bradycardia (HR <60 bpm) unresponsive to bag-mask ventilation and 
continued poor perfusion who remain responsive, support perfusion with fluid resuscitation and 
epinephrine administration. For patients with persistent poor perfusion and severe ALOC, begin chest 
compressions, administer epinephrine, and assess need for TCP. If you have concerns about 
initiating these therapies, contact Base Physician for further guidance. 
 
❸  Potential causes of unresponsiveness to epinephrine in children include increased intracranial 
pressure, beta blocker/calcium channel overdose, hypothyroidism, infection, congenital heart 
disease, and sleep apnea where administration of atropine could be theoretically benefit. 
 
❹  There are minimal data on the use of TCP in infants and children in the out-of-hospital setting. 
Patients unresponsive to BMV and epinephrine may be candidates. Base Physician consultation is 
recommended in these patients. 
 
❺  Consider calcium channel blocker and beta blocker overdose in patients with bradycardia and 
hypotension. Ask about potential exposure including medications in the home. Hyperglycemia is a 
common finding with calcium channel blocker overdose.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Sinus tachycardia is common and SVT is rare. Consider sinus tachycardia in patients with history of 
fever, volume loss (e.g., vomiting or diarrhea), or congenital heart disease. An indication of sinus 
tachycardia is narrow complex and beat-to-beat variability seen on the ECG. Vital signs vary by age 
and normal ranges can be found in MCG 1309. Any pediatric patient with vital signs outside the 
normal range for age should be considered potentially ill and transported to an EDAP or PMC if 
criteria are met. 
 
❷    Contraindications: 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Degree Heart Blocks; history of Sick Sinus Syndrome 
 
❸    For failure to convert or transient conversion to normal sinus rhythm, consider expedited transport. 
 
❹ Regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia may be a supraventricular rhythm with a bundle 
branch or aberrancy. In this case, Adenosine may convert the rhythm to sinus and American Heart 
Association guidelines recommend its use for regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Any delivery after the first trimester (12 weeks) should be considered childbirth for the purposes of 
this treatment protocol and paramedics should contact Base to discuss the management and 
transport.  In general, delivery prior to 20 weeks gestation is nonviable and does not require 
resuscitation. However, dates can be incorrectly estimated, therefore, Base Contact is strongly 
encouraged.  Any potentially viable birth should be resuscitated in the field and transported to a 
perinatal center that is also an EDAP (with a NICU if ≤34 weeks gestation).  Births prior to 20 weeks 
do not necessarily require specialty center care and can be transported to the MAR. 
 
❷    Delay in clamping and cutting the cord for up 30 to 60 seconds is recommended unless newborn 
needs immediate resuscitation. 
 
❸    Some bleeding is normal during delivery, typically up to 500mL. Bleeding is reduced with fundal 
massage after placental delivery, which promotes contraction of the uterus. Post-partum hemorrhage 
is defined as blood loss with signs of poor perfusion and/or cumulative blood loss ≥1000mL.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   This protocol is to be used for the newly born only, infants otherwise within the first month of life use 
TP 1210-P Pediatric Cardiac Arrest. The most important intervention for a resuscitation of the newly 
born in the field is to “Dry, Warm and Stimulate” – this allows for reversal of apnea after delivery. 
 
❷   ”Dry, Warm, and Stimulate then you have to Ventilate” – If respiratory effort poor or HR < 100bmp 
then Ventilate using BMV. The most important signs to monitor are respiratory effort, pulse oximetry 
and heart rate. Measuring the pulse oximetry on the right hand provides the most accurate oxygen 
saturation in infants that are transitioning from fetal to normal circulation. At 60 seconds, 60% is the 
target with an increase of 5% every minute until 5 minutes of life when oximetry is 80-85%.

❸ Suction prior to delivery is no longer recommended for presence of meconium (thick or thin). 
Suctioning should occur only if there is airway obstruction present and the mouth should be 
suctioned first followed by the nose. 
 
❹ Delay in clamping and cutting the cord for up to 30 to 60 seconds is recommended unless the 
newborn needs immediate resuscitation. 
 
❺ Assessing pulse at the base of the umbilical cord is preferred, pulse rate <100bpm is a sign of 
newborn distress and requires BMV. 
 
❻ In obtaining vascular access, place an IO in a newborn use light pressure as the bone cortices are 
soft and the needle can easily penetrate both cortices of the bone. 
 
❼   Chest compressions should be initiated in newborns with a pulse < 60bpm and continued until the 
pulse increases > 60bpm

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Pediatric patients who are pregnant must be evaluated for child maltreatment and are at high risk for 
complications during delivery for the mother and the newborn. 
 
❷    This protocol was intended for complications of pregnancy at the time of delivery; if patient is known 
to be pregnant and has complaints not associated with labor or delivery treat per TP 1202-P, General 
Medical or most applicable protocol. 
 
❸    If the patient has vaginal bleeding associated with known pregnancy >20 weeks, contact Base and 
communicate signs and symptoms so that the receiving hospital can pre-notify OB consultants as 
needed. 
 
❹    Any delivery after the first trimester (12 weeks) should be considered childbirth for the purposes of 
this treatment protocol and paramedics should contact Base to discuss the management and 
transport. In general, delivery prior to 20 weeks gestation is nonviable and does not require 
resuscitation. However; dates can be incorrectly estimated; therefore, Base Contact is strongly 
encouraged. Any potentially viable birth should be resuscitated in the field and transported to a 
perinatal center that is also an EDAP (with a NICU if ≤34 weeks gestation). Births prior to 20 weeks 
do not necessarily require specialty center care and can be transported to the MAR. 
 
❺    In addition to manually elevating the presenting part from the umbilical cord, placing the patient in 
Trendelenburg position during transport can help to elevate the presenting part off the cord to 
maintain blood flow to the fetus. Do not attempt to push a prolapsed cord back in. 
 
❻   Shoulder dystocia is inability to deliver the anterior shoulder, which usually occurs in large newborns.  
If delivery fails to progress after head delivers, hyperflex mother’s hips tightly in knee to chest 
position (McRobert’s maneuver) and apply firm suprapubic pressure in attempt to dislodge anterior 
shoulder. 
 
❼    Hypertension in a pregnant or recently post-partum is a sign of pre-eclampsia, which required 
immediate emergency and obstetric care. Additional signs of pre-eclampsia are edema and 
headache which can progress to seizures (eclampsia). Patients who are ≥ 20 weeks pregnant or ≤ 6 
weeks post-partum with hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90mmHg should be transported to a Perinatal 
Center for evaluation. 
 
❽   Some bleeding is normal during delivery, typically up to 500mL. Bleeding is reduced with fundal 
massage after placental delivery, which promotes contraction of the uterus. Post-partum hemorrhage 
is defined as blood loss with signs of poor perfusion and/or cumulative blood loss ≥1000mLs.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Epinephrine is the drug of choice for allergic reactions with any one of the following: angioedema, 
respiratory compromise or poor perfusion. It should be given IM into a large muscle group, lateral 
thigh preferred or alternatively the lateral gluteus. Vital signs vary by age and normal ranges can be 
found in MCG 1309. Any pediatric patient with vital signs outside the normal range for age should be 
considered potentially ill and transported to an EDAP or PMC if criteria are met. 
 
❷    Patients with wheezing due to allergic reaction should be treated with Epinephrine IM. Albuterol may 
be administered in addition to Epinephrine IM if wheezing persists. 
 
❸ Consider blow-by to avoid agitation in pediatric patients if a mask cannot be tolerated (e.g., infants 
and toddlers).   
 
❹ Diphenhydramine does not treat anaphylaxis. For patients in anaphylaxis, Epinephrine administration 
is the first priority. Diphenhydramine may be considered once other treatments are complete or in 
stable patients with discomfort for isolated hives.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Consider potential for carbon monoxide and/or cyanide toxicity in closed space fires. Pulse oximetry   
is not accurate in carbon monoxide poisoning. (TP 1238-P, Carbon Monoxide Poisoning)  
 
❷    Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body       
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat.  
 
❸    EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to accepting 
ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkept home, evidence of drug 
or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or suspected domestic violence), when the history 
does not match with the severity of physical findings (e.g., child posturing after a roll off the couch), 
when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, whip marks on the 
skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. Children < 3 years 
of age and those with developmental delay are at increased risk of abuse. This must also be 
accompanied by notification to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). 
 
❹    Observe for hypothermia; cooling large surface area burns (>10% body surface area) may result in 
hypothermia.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶    Do not touch the patient unless you have removed the source of the electricity. An electrical current 
can be conducted through water and skin. Ensure that area surrounding the patient is dry before 
approaching him/her.  
 
❷   Consider prolonged cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.  
 
❸    Electrocution may result in ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole or other 
dysrhythmias. However, if the patient is in a regular rhythm on evaluation, they are unlikely to 
develop a dysrhythmia. 
 
❹   Superficial skin findings do not correlate with the severity of an electrical burn. As the electrical 
current passes through tissue, it can cause more damage than is superficially present.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Cardiac arrest from drowning should be treated per TP 1210-P, Cardiac Arrest. Ventilation is 
particularly important as the cardiac arrest is almost always due to respiratory failure. In cases of cold 
water drowning follow usual protocols for resuscitation while simultaneously rewarming the patient. 
Patients with hypothermia due to cold water drowning, may have good neurologic outcome despite 
prolonged resuscitation; resuscitative efforts should continue until the patient is rewarmed.  
Consultation with the Base Physician is required before consideration of termination of resuscitation 
in patients with suspected hypothermia. 
 
❷  Decompression illness includes arterial gas embolism from barotrauma and decompression   
sickness (aka “the bends”) due to dissolved nitrogen in the blood coming out of solution.  
Decompression illness most frequently occurs in scuba divers after breathing compressed air at 
depth. While arterial gas embolism presents almost immediately after ascent, decompression 
sickness is often delayed and should be considered in any patient with symptoms (e.g. respiratory 
distress, ALOC, chest or body pain) within 24 hours of completing a dive. All patients with possible 
decompression illness need immediate evaluation for possible hyperbaric treatment. Per Ref. 518, 
contact Base immediately to discuss. 
 
❸    Warming measures should include moving the patient to a warm environment as quickly as possible, 
removing wet clothing/items, covering with an emergency/rescue blanket or other blankets/sheets, 
and using warm Normal Saline if available.  
 
❹ Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body 
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat. 
 
❺  Rales may be present in patients after submersion/drowning due to direct lung injury and/or 
aspiration of water. This is not an indication of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (such as from 
congestive heart failure), which is extremely rare in children, and does not prohibit administration of 
IV fluids. IV fluids should be initiated and continued unless respiratory status worsens during 
administration. 
 
❻ EMS is assisting the Department of Public Health (DPH) in promptly investigating fatal or nonfatal 
drownings at public pools or spas in order to ensure safety can be verified before reopening. 
Contacting the on-call DPH officer will allow timely investigation of these incidents and prevent future 
incidents.

❷    EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to accepting 
ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkempt home, evidence of 
drug or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or suspected domestic violence), when the 
history does not match with the severity of physical findings (e.g., child posturing after a roll off the 
couch), when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, whip marks 
on the skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. Children < 3 
years of age and those with developmental delay are at increased risk of abuse. This must also be 
accompanied by notification to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).

❶    Dizziness is often used to describe two different feelings; vertigo and lightheadedness. Vertigo is the 
sensation of a person or their surroundings moving when no actual movement is occurring. People 
often describe the feeling of spinning, falling, tilting, or being off balance. This is often associated with 
nausea/vomiting. Lightheadedness can lead to feeling faint or syncope, and the patient often reports 
improvement with supine position. Vertigo is an unusual complaint for children and should be taken 
as a possible sign of serious disease.

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Patients who are lightheaded and/or tachycardic when sitting and/or standing compared to lying 
down, referred to as orthostatic, are likely dehydrated and in need for fluid resuscitation. Syncope 
can result from a lack of adequate perfusion to the brain, and in the setting of suspected dehydration 
or fluid losses, this can be a sign of poor perfusion. Therefore, for patients who present with syncope 
with orthostasis and/or dehydration, fluid resuscitation is appropriate unless contraindicated.    
 
❷    In females of child-bearing age with syncope, ask about possible pregnancy and any history of 
vaginal bleeding. One cause of syncope in females is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This can be life 
threatening and may present with poor perfusion and require fluid resuscitation with Normal Saline.  
Contact Base if patient known to be pregnant. 
 
❸    Syncope in children is most often a result of vasovagal syncope and transport to an EDAP is 
appropriate. However, syncope associated with a dysrhythmia or ALOC indicates a serious 
underlying disease and patients should be transported to a PMC.

REVISED: 07-01-22 PAGE 182 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   In evaluation of patient with suspected airway obstruction, assessment of the airway should include 
the tongue and posterior oropharynx, including uvula and tonsillar pillars. 
 
❷ Supraglottic airway placement is contraindicated for patients with upper airway obstruction> 
 
❸ Consider blow-by to avoid agitation in pediatric patients if a mask cannot be tolerated (e.g., infants 
and toddlers). 
 
❹  Common tracheostomy emergencies include obstruction of the tracheostomy tube and bleeding.  
There are different types of tracheostomy tubes, some with an inner cannula and/or obturator. The 
obturator obstructs airflow and is usually only used during insertion. The inner cannula allows for 
connection to a ventilator or bag mask for positive pressure ventilation. Tracheostomy tubes may be 
cuffed (balloon inflated in the trachea as indicated by a side port) or uncuffed. If the tracheostomy 
does not have a cuff, the airway is not protected against aspiration and air can leak out through the 
mouth during positive-pressure ventilation. If respiratory failure occurs in a patient with an uncuffed 
tracheostomy tube, it should be replaced with a cuffed endotracheal tube (if the appropriate size is 
available) if feasible in order to facilitate positive-pressure ventilation. For bleeding, direct pressure 
should be applied and suctioning as needed to reduce aspiration of blood. 
 
❺ The inner cannula is required to attach a ventilator or bag mask to a tracheostomy for positive-
pressure ventilation. It may become obstructed with secretions; remove, clean with saline, and 
replace once obstruction is relieved. If it cannot be replaced, cover the stoma with gauze and begin 
BMV via the mouth.  If no chest rise, place a small mask over the stoma and begin stoma-mask 
ventilation. 
 
❻ Removal and reinsertion of the tracheostomy tube is contraindicated if the tracheostomy is < 1 week 
old because the stoma has not fully formed and a false tract may be created. Once the stoma has 
matured, a tracheostomy can be safely removed and replaced when necessary. If a flexible 
intubation guide (e.g., Bougie) can be inserted, it may be used to guide the removal and reinsertion 
of the tracheostomy or endotracheal tube.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Obtain thorough history or physical examination that one or more of the following occurred and is 
          resolved: cyanosis or pallor, absent, decreased, or irregular breathing, marked change in  
      tone (hyper- or hypotonia), or altered level of responsiveness – document Provider Impression BRUE 
 
❷    Patients with a brief resolved unexplained event or a BRUE require Base Contact and transport to a   
      PMC. For patients with ongoing signs of serious illness Base Contact should be made for discussion  
      on appropriate destination. Vital signs vary by age and normal ranges can be found in MCG 1309.  
Any pediatric patient with vital signs outside the normal range for age should be considered 
potentially ill and transported to an EDAP or PMC if criteria are met. 
 
❸    EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to accepting 
ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkempt home, evidence of 
drug or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or suspected domestic violence), when the 
history does not match with the severity of physical findings (e.g., child posturing after a roll off the 
couch), when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, whip marks 
on the skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. Children < 3 
years of age and those with developmental delay are at increased risk of abuse. This must also be 
accompanied by notification to the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). 
 
❹    Support respiration prn with BMV using “squeeze-release-release” technique; hyperventilation has  
      negative effects on coronary and cerebral perfusion and should be avoided.  
 
❺    In infants < 1 month of age with increasing respiratory distress after fluid resuscitation, stop infusion 
as it may be a result of volume overload and contact Base for medical direction.

REVISED: 04-01-25 PAGE 190 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶   Consider wearing surgical mask when caring for patients with respiratory distress of unclear etiology, 
which may be infectious. 
  
❷ Patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease may be expected to have a measured SpO2 of 75-
85%. Parents/caretakers may also know the patient’s “normal” SpO2 range. It is important to ask 
caretakers and consider this possibility, as administration of Oxygen in these patients will worsen 
respiratory status. 
 
❸ Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with a viral filter is the preferred method of airway management for 
pediatric patients. Initiate BMV to assess patient response. Effective BMV may improve the patient’s 
respiratory status enough to restore adequate spontaneous respirations.  Place advanced airway 
placement if BMV is ineffective or consider placement once assessment for rapidly reversible causes 
is complete as authorized per MCG 1302; supraglottic airway (sizing per MCG 1309) is preferred 
unless contraindicated. Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, 
circumstances, and skill level when selecting the advanced airway modality for pediatric patients in 
whom multiple modalities are authorized. 
 
❹ If positive pressure ventilation is performed at any time, document Provider Impression as 
Respiratory Arrest / Respiratory Failure. 
 
❺ Fowler’s or Semi-Fowler’s positioning is likely to be most comfortable for awake patients with 
respiratory distress. Avoid agitating children with suspected partial foreign body obstruction and/or 
impending airway failure. Allow parents/caretakers to handle/facilitate patient if safe to do so. 
 
❻ In pediatric patients with respiratory distress, bradycardia is likely to represent a pre-terminal event, 
ensure that oxygenation and ventilation is adequate ; bradycardic dysrhythmia is persistent despite 
adequate oxygenation and ventilation before moving to TP 1212-P, Cardiac Dysrhythmia – 
Bradycardia. Respiratory rates vary by age and normal ranges can be found in MCG 1309. 
 
❼ Consider blow-by to avoid agitation in pediatric patients if a mask cannot be tolerated (e.g., infants 
and toddlers).  
 
❽ Administration of albuterol via metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer is considered equivalent to 
nebulized albuterol; a spacer is typically required for this route to be effective in novice users. MDIs 
are single use and should be left with the hospital staff upon handoff of the patient. 
 
❾ Epinephrine may be administered prior to albuterol as initial drug therapy in patients with Respiratory 
Failure due to bronchospasm. 
 
❿ While CPAP may be used in pediatric patients, current ALS equipment does not support use of 
CPAP in pediatric patients who are not longer than the length-based resuscitation tape (e.g., 
Broselow Tape™).  
 
⓫ Etiologies of respiratory distress in pediatrics are varied; etiologies may include the following: 
• Bronchospasm due to asthma, bronchiolitis, reactive airway disease or viral illness – 
document Provider Impression as Respiratory Distress / Bronchospasm

otherwise the Base Hospital should be notified as specified in this protocol, and if no Base Hospital 
required then the receiving hospital will be notified.  
 
❷    Nerve agent exposure symptom severity: 
 SEVERE: severe respiratory distress, respiratory arrest, cyanosis, extreme SLUDGE (salivation,     
lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress and emesis) seizures, unconsciousness 
      MODERATE: miosis, rhinorrhea, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhea 
 MILD: miosis, rhinorrhea and increased salivation 
       
❸    Radiation Exposure Safety: 
      Exposure to victims with internal radiation poses low-to-no risk to EMS personnel  
      Exposure to victims with external radiation exposure poses low-to-moderate risk to EMS personnel  
      Remember the following principles: 
Time: limit time with the victim to a minimum 
Distance: the further away from the source, the smaller the dose received. 
Shielding: “Turnouts” will protect from alpha and beta emitters, wear respiratory protection if 
particulate matter (i.e., dust or powder) present 
 
❹    The HAZMAT team, MAC, or Department of Public Health Radiation Management will be able to 
redefine boundaries, establish radiation dose guidelines, assist with monitoring and decontamination 
procedures, and provide support to on-scene responders. These resources may also refer to 
Emergency Response Guidebook for other recommended scene precautions. 
 
❺   If number of patients exceeds available resources, asymptomatic patients with minimal exposure may 
be released for home decontamination.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶  The first priority for apneic patients after narcotic overdose is to begin positive pressure ventilation.  
Once ventilations are established, naloxone should be administered with the goal of restoring 
spontaneous ventilations.  Vascular access should not take priority over initial treatment with 
Naloxone (IN or IM) for patients with suspected opiate overdose. Patients who are awake and alert 
with normal respirations after naloxone therapy may not require IV access or additional doses of 
naloxone. 
 
❷    Higher dose pre-packaged nasal spray should not be used in the newborn/neonate due to potential 
risk to precipitate withdrawal. 
 
❸    Signs of calcium channel overdose include bradycardia along with hypotension and hyperglycemia. 
Signs of beta blocker overdose include bradycardia along with hypotension and hypoglycemia, 
Consider when the patient is taking or has access to a calcium channel and/or beta blocker 
medication. Ask about potential exposures including medications in the home. 
 
❹   ECG findings consistent with tricyclic overdose include wide QRS (>0.12mm) and terminal R in aVR. 
Consider when the patient is taking or has access to a tricyclic medication. Ask about potential 
exposures including medications in the home. 
 
❺  EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect. Communicate concerns about 
child abuse and/or neglect to accepting ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for 
harm (e.g., unkempt home, evidence of drug or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or 
suspected domestic violence), when the history does not match with the severity of physical findings 
(e.g., child posturing after a roll off the couch), when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular 
burns as from a cigarette, whip marks on the skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports 
physical or sexual abuse. Children < 3 years of age and those with developmental delay are at 
increased risk of abuse. This must also be accompanied by notification to Department of Children 
and Family Service

1200 Table of Contents 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶      Crush syndrome is a systemic illness characterized by dysrhythmias and shock. It results from toxins 
released from crushed muscle tissue into the blood stream. Patients are at risk for crush syndrome if 
they have all of the following: 1) circumferential compression causing crush injury; AND 2) 
involvement of a large muscle group (lower extremity including the thigh(s) and/or pelvic girdle or 
upper extremity including the pectoral girdle); AND 3) entrapment for at least 1 hour. The risk of 
crush syndrome increases with the amount of muscle involved and the duration of the entrapment.   
 
❷    For patients requiring transport to a Pediatric Trauma Center per Ref. 506, which is also a Base 
Hospital, contact receiving Pediatric Trauma Center for Base Medical Direction and notification.  
If the Base Hospital is contacted and the Base redirects transport to a Pediatric Trauma Center, 
Base personnel will notify the Pediatric Trauma Center. 
 
❸    A backboard is not required for spinal motion restriction (SMR) and may cause harm as well as 
increased pain. Patients should not be transported on a backboard for the purpose of SMR. If a 
backboard is used for extrication, patients who are alert should then be logrolled onto the gurney 
prior to transport. The backboard may be used during patient transport for splinting of multiple 
simultaneous extremity fractures or to assist with maneuvering the unconscious patient. In all cases, 
the backboard should be removed immediately if causing respiratory compromise.   
 
❹    Patients with significant crush injury at risk for crush syndrome require large volumes of fluid 
resuscitation. Patients with prolonged entrapment will require maintenance fluids. IO access should 
be considered when attempts at IV access are not successful if: 1) prolonged entrapment is likely (> 
30 minutes) and/or 2) there are signs of hyperkalemia and/or 3) there is risk of crush syndrome 
requiring medication administration. 
 
❺    Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body 
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat. 
 
❻    Flush the IV line with normal saline after each medication. Administration of Calcium and 
Bicarbonate together will cause precipitation of the medication. 
 
❼ Dosing differs from MCG 1309; higher doses of albuterol are required to treat hyperkalemia.   
Consider blow-by to avoid agitation in pediatric patients if a mask cannot be tolerated (e.g., infants 
and toddlers). 
 
❽    The duration of action of the medications is approximately 30 minutes. Contact Base to discuss re- 
dosing the medications if persistent signs of hyperkalemia or if the patient will not arrive at the 
hospital within 30 minutes. 
 
❾    These medications should be administered prior to release of the compressive force to prevent 
complications from the cellular toxins that enter the circulation upon extrication of the patient.  
Calcium stabilizes the cardiac muscle and should be administered first.   
 
❿   Tourniquet placement PRIOR to extrication is a last resort for patients who are at risk for crush 
syndrome in whom vascular access cannot be established or when transport time is anticipated to 
be > 30 minutes. The tourniquet must completely occlude venous and arterial flow in order to protect 
the patient from crush syndrome. Establish vascular access and cardiac monitoring immediately

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶ EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to 
accepting ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkept home,

roll off the couch), when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, 
whip marks on the skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. 
Children < 3 years of age and those with developmental delay are at increased risk of abuse. This 
must also be accompanied by notification to the Department of Children and Family Services 
(DCFS). 
 
❷     Rapid transport after hemorrhage control is the priority for all patients with severe trauma. With the 
exception of hemorrhage control, needle thoracostomy, and initiation of CPR, all other procedures 
may be deferred for immediate ambulance loading of patient and performed en route. 
 
❸    Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) with a viral filter is the preferred initial method of airway management. 
An advanced airway may be placed during transport or if BMV is difficult or ineffective as authorized 
per MCG 1302; supraglottic airway (sizing per MCG 1309) is preferred unless contraindicated. 
Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, circumstances, and skill level 
when selecting the advanced airway modality for pediatric patients in whom multiple modalities are 
authorized. 
 
❹    Patients with penetrating trauma should receive defibrillation while still prioritizing early transport. 
 
❺      Sudden cardiac death can result from blunt cardiac injury (commotio cordis) triggering V-fib/V-tach.  
Unlike major trauma resulting in hemorrhagic shock, patients with this mechanism typically have 
minimal external trauma and should be treated with immediate defibrillation on scene.  Patients 
with multisystem blunt trauma in persistent cardiac arrest without organized rhythm should generally 
not be transported.  If commotio cordis is the suspected mechanism with minimal external trauma 
and the patient remains in V-fib/V-tach after three defibrillations, contact Base to discuss timing of 
transport versus termination for futility. 
 
❻  For patients in traumatic arrest, spinal motion restriction (SMR) using a backboard causes harmful 
delays in care. However, a backboard may be helpful to assist in patient movement and to support 
chest compressions.

mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat. 
 
❻ Traumatic events may be due to a medical emergency, e.g. seizure. 
 
❼  Placement of a vented dressing can prevent conversion of an open pneumothorax to a tension 
pneumothorax. However, tension pneumothorax may still develop in the presence of a vented 
dressing and should be treated with needle thoracostomy. Furthermore, needle thoracostomy in a 
patient with evidence of tension pneumothorax should not be delayed for placement of dressing. 
 
❽ Fluid resuscitation increases vascular pressure and dilutes clotting factors, which may increase 
internal bleeding. For patients at risk of internal hemorrhage, fluids should only be administered for 
SBP < 70mmHg and other signs of poor perfusion, titrated to maintain SBP ≥ 70mmHg. In patients 
with penetrating trauma, permissive hypotension (withholding fluids if patient has normal mental 
status) is preferred to reduce ongoing blood loss. Patients with ALOC or SBP < 70mmHg should 
receive fluids until their mental status and SBP improve. Permissive hypotension is contraindicated in 
patients with possible traumatic brain injury.

❾    Vomiting should be prevented and/or immediately treated in patients with head injury, since it 
increases intra-cranial pressure and can compromise the patient’s airway. 
 
❿   Any hypoxic episode, even brief, is associated with worse patient outcome for patients with traumatic 
brain injury. 
 
⓫ Hyperventilation reduces blood flow to the brain by reducing CO
2
 and is associated with worse 
outcomes in severe head injuries. Ventilate to maintain an ETCO
2
 in the range 35-45mmHg.  
 
⓬    Any hypotension increases mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. Normal Saline should be 
initiated to maintain SBP within normal range for age at all times but can be withheld if the blood 
pressure is elevated. The level of systolic blood pressure varies by age. Those thresholds are found 
in MCG 1309 and should be used in decisions for fluid resuscitation.  
  
⓭    A head-elevated position at about 30 degrees reduces intra-cranial pressure and improves 
respiratory status. Reverse Trendelenburg is an option for patients that cannot be seated. Patients 
who are hypotensive should be maintained supine unless airway compromise requires repositioning. 
 
⓮    Open femur fracture is not a contraindication to apply the traction splint. If the bone is protruding and 
there is gross contamination, wash with saline prior to applying the splint.

Medical Control Guideline: AIRWAY MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING 
1200 Table of Contents 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Advanced Airway Maneuvers: Use of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ET) or supraglottic airway 
(SGA), e.g., i-gel, to facilitate ventilation and/or oxygenation in a patient who is unable to protect 
his/her own airway or maintain spontaneous ventilation. 
 
Attempt Advanced Airway Placement: Insertion of the laryngoscope into the mouth for the 
purposes of intubation (for endotracheal intubation (ETI)); insertion of the SGA into the mouth. 
 
Basic Airway Maneuvers: Manual airway positioning, obstructed airway maneuvers, bag-
mask-ventilation (BMV), and/or use of airway adjuncts (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal 
airways) to provide ventilation and/or to facilitate oxygenation in a patient who is unable to 
maintain adequate spontaneous ventilation. 
 
Emerging Infectious Disease (EID): Infectious diseases that have newly appeared in a 
population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range, or that 
are caused by one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category 
A, B, or C priority pathogens. 
 
Hypoxia: Lower than normal oxygen (O
2
) concentration in the blood resulting in diminished 
availability of O
2
 to the body tissues. 
 
Hyperoxia: Exposure of cells, tissues and organs to an excess supply of oxygen. 
 
Hypoventilation: Ventilation that is inadequate to support gas exchange in the lung.  
 
Manageable Airway: Ventilation is effective, such that one of the following holds true: 
a. Patient is breathing adequately through a patent airway. 
b. Patient is mechanically ventilated effectively via bag-mask-ventilation (BMV), 
SGA or ET. 
 
Unmanageable Airway: The patient is not able to breathe adequately, and EMS personnel are 
not able to maintain the patient’s airway and/or cannot ventilate the patient effectively via BMV, 
SGA or ET. 
 
Secure Airway: The patient’s trachea is isolated from the risk of aspiration via a cuffed ET in 
the trachea.   
 
Successful Advanced Airway Placement:  Placement of the device such that the patient can 
be ventilated with minimal or no air leak, confirmed primarily with end-tidal CO
2
 measurement 
with capnography.  Secondary confirmation methods include visible chest rise during ventilation 
and air movement on pulmonary auscultation. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Signs and symptoms of hypoxia may include O
2
 saturation (SpO
2
) < 94% with 
respiratory distress, altered mental status or changes in skin signs. 
 

SUBJECT:  AIRWAY MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING REFERENCE NO. 1302 
 
 
REVISED: 04-01-25 PAGE 218 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
 
2. Providing O
2
 to emergency medical services (EMS) patients may be a lifesaving 
procedure. Both hypoxia and hyperoxia are potentially harmful; therefore, O
2
 should be 
treated like any other drug and administered when indicated. 
 
3. Hypoventilation results in high arterial carbon dioxide (CO
2
).  In general, this results in an 
end-tidal CO
2
 > 45mmHg on capnography, but end-tidal CO
2 
may not reflect arterial CO
2
 
when lung disease and/or increased dead space are present. 
 
4. Basic airway maneuvers should be performed prior to advanced airway maneuvers on 
patients with hypoventilation. 
 
5. Techniques and procedures utilized for airway management may vary based on 
operational environment, patient condition and the EMS personnel’s level of training and 
expertise. 
 
6. Patients with unmanageable airway shall be transported to the most accessible receiving 
facility. 
 
7. In Los Angeles County, endotracheal intubation (ETI) and the supraglottic airway (SGA) 
i-gel are approved advanced airway options. 
 
8. ETI provides a secure airway. SGAs may not protect the patient from aspiration. 
However, the device is easier to place than an ET and can provide effective ventilations 
to most patients in need of an advanced airway. 
 
9. SGA placement is recommended when a patient’s medical condition or anatomy predicts 
likely failure of ETI and in situations where prehospital personnel attempt but are unable 
to successfully perform ETI.  If ventilation via SGA is effective, it should not be removed 
and replaced with an ET. 
 
10. SGA is the preferred advanced airway for patients experiencing cardiac arrest.  
 
11. Advanced airway placement must be verified and continually monitored.  
 
12. Pulse oximetry and capnography are essential tools for monitoring the effectiveness of 
airway management. While pulse oximetry monitors oxygenation, it does not assess 
adequacy of ventilation. Capnography is necessary to monitor ventilation. Capnography 
is most accurate with proper two-person BMV technique or advanced airway. 
 
13. Hyperventilation (end-tidal CO
2
 <30 mmHg), by rate or volume or both, should be 
avoided.  
 
a. Hyperventilation, when applied inappropriately, increases intrathoracic pressure 
reducing venous return and cardiac output, and is particularly harmful in low-flow 
states including cardiac arrest. It results in low arterial carbon dioxide (CO
2
), 
which is harmful in multiple conditions, such as mild or moderate traumatic brain 
injury. Further, it can cause pulmonary injury including barotrauma and increased 
incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

14. Under rare circumstances, targeted mild hyperventilation (end-tidal CO
2
 30-35 mmHG) 
may be indicated for comatose patients with signs of severe traumatic brain injury and 
impending herniation or to match a patient’s physiology in cases of severe metabolic 
acidosis.  
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. If pulse oximetry is not available (BLS Unit) and the patient is in mild or moderate 
respiratory distress, provide O
2
 with nasal cannula at 2-6 liters per minute. 
 
2. When available, use pulse oximetry to guide oxygen therapy.  The desired SpO
2
 for 
most non-critical patients is 94-98%. Document pulse oximetry reading. 
 
3. Initiate immediate high-flow O
2
 (15 L/min) for the following conditions: 
a. Respiratory Arrest (impending or actual) 
b. Cardiac Arrest 
c. Shock/Poor Perfusion (including anaphylactic shock) 
d. Traumatic Brain Injury 
e. Carbon Monoxide Exposure 
f. Suspected Pneumothorax 
g. Hypoxia <94% not corrected with nasal cannula or simple mask 
 
4. If high-flow O
2
 is indicated, use one of the following O
2
 delivery system based on the 
patient’s condition: 
a. Non-rebreather mask  
b. BMV with reservoir  
c. Endotracheal tube  
d. Supraglottic airway (SGA)  
e. CPAP per MCG 1315 
 
5. For stable patients with mild hypoxia (SpO
2
 less than 94%), start O
2 
with nasal cannula 
at 2-6 L/min or simple mask at 8-10 L/min if available. If patient is unable to tolerate 
nasal cannula or mask, use blow-by technique with O
2
 flowing at 15 L/min. 
 
6. Consider the following special populations when titrating oxygen therapy: 
a. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) – goal SpO
2
 is 88 – 92% 
b. Newborns in need of positive-pressure ventilation – ventilate for 90 seconds with 
room air, if heart rate remains less than 100 beats per minute, start O
2
 at 15 L/min 
c. Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease – use O
2
 with caution if known history of low 
baseline O
2
 saturation 
 
7. Continue to monitor SpO
2
 and titrate O
2
 therapy as appropriate for the patient’s clinical 
condition until transfer of patient care. 
 
8. Document the SpO
2
,
 
O
2
 delivery system used, and the liters per minute administered. 
 
9. If suctioning is required, pre-oxygenate (as applicable) prior to suctioning and do not 
suction longer than 10 seconds per occurrence.  For tracheal suctioning, maintain sterile 
procedures.

10. Considerations for oropharyngeal airway: 
a. Unresponsive patient requiring BMV – should be utilized in all such patients where 
gag reflex is absent  
b. In pediatric patients, placement may not be necessary to achieve adequate 
ventilation 
 
11. Considerations for nasopharyngeal airway: 
a. Spontaneously breathing patients who require assistance in maintaining a patent 
airway (e.g., seizure patient, intoxication) 
b. Unresponsive patients requiring BMV in whom an oropharyngeal airway cannot be 
inserted 
 
12. Considerations for BMV: 
a. Apnea or agonal respirations 
b. Altered level of consciousness with hypoventilation or hypoxia despite maximal 
supplemental O
2
 
 
13. Considerations for ETI: 
Adults or Pediatrics 12 years or greater, or longer than the length-based resuscitation 
tape (e.g., Broselow Tape™) 
a. Ineffective ventilation with BMV 
b. Prolonged transport time 
c. Risk for aspiration 
d. Other determined need for advanced airway and SGA contraindicated 
 
14. Considerations for SGA i-gel: 
a. Adult and pediatric patients experiencing respiratory and/or cardiac arrest with 
ineffective BMV 
b. Adult and pediatric patients experiencing respiratory arrest after initial BMV 
c. Adult and pediatric patients experiencing cardiac arrest after initial priorities of the 
resuscitation are met including: 
• Shockable rhythms: defibrillation x2 
• Nonshockable rhythms: epinephrine x1 and reversible causes addressed prn 
• Traumatic arrest: hemorrhage control and transport initiated 
d. Adult and pediatric patients after return of spontaneous circulation 
e. Need for advanced airway and suspected difficult ETI based on assessment and 
anatomical features 
f. Unsuccessful attempts (maximum three attempts) at ETI (with or without the use of a 
flexible introducer guide) 
 
15. i-gel size is based on patient’s ideal body weight (MCG 1309).  Patients in between sizes 
may require changing sizes if the initial selection results in leak.  Initial size should be 
based on the table below. 
 
i-gel size selection

16. Considerations for stoma intubation: 
a. Adult patients with tracheostomy obstruction unrelieved by suctioning and 
replacing inner cannula. 
b. Adult patients with respiratory failure with an uncuffed tracheostomy tube. 
c. For pediatric patients, and for adult patients in which a new tube cannot be 
placed, perform bag mask ventilation via mouth (while covering the stoma) or 
stoma (if no chest rise with mask over mouth).  
 
17. Verify endotracheal tube or rescue airway placement utilizing capnography.  In case of 
device failure, use an End-tidal CO
2
 detector. Document the method used for placement 
verification. 
 
18. Additional confirmation of endotracheal tube placement shall include all of the following: 
a. Bilateral lung sounds 
b. Bilateral chest rise 
c. Absent gastric sounds 
d. Pulse oximetry 
 
19. Continuously assess ventilation status and monitor capnography for all patients requiring 
BMV or advanced airway placement. Report capnography reading to the base hospital 
and document capnography reading as follows: 
a. Every five minutes during transport 
b. After any patient movement 
c. With any change in patient condition 
d. Upon transfer of care 
 
20. Ventilation should be performed at the correct rate and tidal volume according to the age 
and size of the patient. 
a. Rate should target the lower range of normal by age. 
b. Tidal volumes should be 6-8ml/kg, which is approximated by squeezing the bag just 
sufficiently to observe chest rise. 
c. Ventilation shall be regulated by use of a manometer and/or airflow meter device. 
i. To ensure appropriate ventilatory pressure, a manometer at target 
pressures of <20 cmH
2
O is recommended, with pressure >40 cm most 
harmful. Pressures between 20-40 cm may be needed to ventilate some 
patients but with caution. 
ii. To ensure appropriate ventilatory volume, use of an airflow meter device 
is recommended, especially when using a bag with >1000mL volume.

Medical Control Guideline: CAPNOGRAPHY 
1200 Table of Contents 
PURPOSE: To describe use of capnography for 911 responses and for inter-facility transfers. 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Capnography: Analysis and recording of carbon dioxide (CO
2
) concentrations in respiratory 
gases via continuous waveform.   
 
Capnometry: Measurement of the amount of carbon dioxide in exhaled air. This gives a 
specific value for the end-tidal CO
2
 measurement. 
 
Colorimetric CO
2
 device: Device that changes color due to a chemical reaction in the 
presence of CO
2
, which can be used to detect CO
2
 in exhaled air in order to confirm placement 
of an advanced airway. 
 
End-Tidal CO
2
 (ETCO
2
): The amount of carbon dioxide measured at the end of exhalation. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Ventilation is an active process, which is assessed with end-tidal CO
2
 measurement. 
End-tidal CO
2
 measurement is an indication of air movement in and out of the lungs. The 
normal value of exhaled CO
2
 is 35-45mmHg.   
 
2. Oxygenation is a passive process, which occurs by diffusion of oxygen across the 
alveolar membrane into the blood. The amount of oxygen available in the bloodstream is 
assessed with pulse oximetry.   
 
3. Capnography provides both a specific value for the end-tidal CO
2
 measurement and a 
continuous waveform representing the amount of CO
2
 in the exhaled air. A normal 
capnography waveform is square, with a slight upslope to the plateau phase during 
exhalation. (See figures below) The height of the waveform at its peak corresponds to 
the ETCO
2
. 
 
4. Capnography is necessary to monitor ventilation. For patients requiring positive pressure 
ventilation, capnography is most accurate with proper mask seal (two-hand mask hold 
for adults during bag-mask ventilation) or with an advanced airway. 
 
5. Capnography can also be applied via a nasal cannula device to measure end-tidal CO
2
 
in the spontaneously breathing patient. It is useful to monitor for hypoventilation, in 
patients who are sedated either due to ingestion of substances or treatment with 
medication with sedative properties such as midazolam or opioids. In a patient with 
suspected sepsis, an ETCO
2
 <25mmHg further supports this provider impression. 
 
6. Capnography is standard of care for confirmation of advanced airway placement. Unlike 
simple colorimetric devices, capnography is also useful to monitor the airway position 
over time, for ventilation management, and for early detection of return of spontaneous 
circulation (ROSC) in patients in cardiac arrest.

 
SUBJECT:  CAPNOGRAPHY REFERENCE NO. 1305  
 
REVISED: 04-01-20  PAGE 225 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
7. Capnography is the most reliable way to immediately confirm advanced airway 
placement. Capnography provides an instantaneous measurement of the amount of CO
2
 
in the exhaled air and absence of waveform and/or values <10mmHg suggest possible 
advanced airway misplacement. However, patients in cardiac arrest or profound shock 
may also have end-tidal CO
2
 values <10 despite proper airway placement. 
 
8. Capnography provides the most reliable way to continuously monitor advanced airway 
position. The waveform provides a continuous assessment of ventilation over time. A 
normal waveform which becomes suddenly absent suggests dislodgement and requires 
clinical confirmation. 
 
9. The value of exhaled CO
2
 is affected by ventilation (effectiveness of CO
2
 elimination), 
perfusion (transportation of CO
2
 in the body) and metabolism (production of CO
2
 via 
cellular metabolism). In addition to the end-tidal CO
2
 value, the ventilation rate as well as 
the size and shape of the capnograph must be used to interpret the results. 
 
10. Decreased perfusion will reduce the blood flow to the tissues, decreasing offload of CO
2
 
from the lungs.  Therefore, patients in shock and patients in cardiac arrest will generally 
have reduced end-tidal CO
2
 values.   
 
11. A sudden increase in perfusion will cause a sudden rise in end-tidal CO
2
 values and is a 
reliable indicator of ROSC. It is common to have an elevated ETCO
2
 reading after 
ROSC. Hyperventilation is harmful and should not be done to attempt to normalize the 
ETCO
2
. 
 
12. Ventilation can have varied effect on CO
2
 measurement. Hyperventilation will reduce 
end-tidal CO
2
 by increasing offload from the lungs. Disorders of ventilation that reduce 
CO
2
 elimination (e.g., COPD), will cause CO
2
 to build up in the body, increasing the 
measured value once ventilation is restored. Generally, hypoventilation will increase 
measured end-tidal CO
2, 
values by decreasing offload from the lungs. However, in 
patients with decreased tidal volumes, hypoventilation can also reduce end-tidal CO
2
, 
because of the relative increase in dead space.  
 
15. End-tidal CO
2
 can be detected using a colorimetric device (ETCO
2
 detector). These 
devices provide limited information about ETCO
2 
as compared to capnography. 
Colorimetric devices do not provide continuous measurement of the value of CO
2
 in the 
exhaled air and cannot be used in ongoing monitoring. Colorimetric devices should only 
be used for confirmation of endotracheal tube placement if capnography is unavailable 
due to equipment failure.  
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Capnography shall be used for ALL patients receiving positive-pressure ventilation (BMV 
or advanced airway). Utilize the capnography waveform to assess the patient’s 
ventilation and perfusion status. Refer to the figures below for examples of typical 
waveform tracings. 
 
2. Always attach the capnography device to the monitor first and wait for the capnography 
display to appear prior to applying the device to the patient. This zeros the device to 
ensure an accurate reading. 
 
3. Apply the capnography device immediately upon initiating any positive-pressure 
ventilation, or as soon as feasible.

REVISED: 04-01-20  PAGE 226 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
4. During bag-mask-ventilation, maintain a continuous seal in order to obtain accurate 
capnography readings. 
 
5. When an advanced airway is place, the capnography device shall be applied/re-applied 
immediately to confirm airway placement, along with assessing bilateral breath sounds 
and absence of gastric sounds.  
 
6. Visualization of a normally shaped waveform with a normal or elevated value confirms 
placement.  Extremely low values (<10mmHg) without the typical waveform implies 
esophageal placement and the endotracheal tube should be removed. For patients in 
shock or cardiac arrest, the value (and height of the waveform) will likely be reduced but 
the shape of the waveform should be normal.   
 
7. Continuously monitor the waveform, report the capnography reading to the base hospital 
and document capnography reading on the patient care record as follows: 
 
a. Immediately after placement of an advanced airway  
b. With any change in patient condition 
c. After any patient movement 
d. Every five minutes during transport 
e. Upon transfer of care 
 
8. For patients in cardiac arrest, continuously monitor capnography during resuscitation.  A 
sudden rise in ETCO
2
, along with an organized rhythm, is a reliable sign of ROSC and 
should prompt a pulse check.  Do not hyperventilate regardless of the ETCO
2
 value; 
elevated values will normalize with proper ventilation.  A drop in ETCO
2
 below normal 
can signify progressive hypotension or re-arrest.   
 
9. Consider use of capnography via nasal cannula, if available, in spontaneously ventilating 
patients who are: 
 
a. Sedated due to illicit substance ingestion  
b. Treated with medications with sedative properties (e.g., midazolam or opioids)   
c. In severe respiratory distress 
 
10. In spontaneously breathing patients, monitor for significant hypoventilation or apnea as 
an indication to begin assisted ventilation. A “shark-fin” waveform on EtCO
2
 monitoring 
indicates bronchospasm; treatment with albuterol is indicated. 
 
11. During positive-pressure ventilation, if a “shark-fin” pattern and/or an elevating EtCO
2
 
waveform (“breath stacking”) is visualized, decrease ventilation rate to avoid increases in 
intrathoracic pressure which can lead to decrease in venous blood return to the heart 
and cardiopulmonary arrest.

EFFECTIVE DATE: 07-01-25 PAGE 230 OF 447 
Medical Control Guideline: EVALUATION AND CARE OF PATIENTS AT RISK OF SUICIDE  
1200 Table of Contents 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Suicide Risk Screening: A standardized method to identify individuals who may be at risk for 
suicide, and to estimate a patient’s current level of risk for suicide by asking specific questions 
about a patient’s thoughts and behaviors.  
 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS, https://cssrs.columbia.edu/) (MCG 
1306.1) is an example of a commonly used, evidence-based method of suicide risk screening 
that can be administered by a variety of personnel, such as all healthcare personnel, law 
enforcement personnel, educators, clergy, and the lay public.  
 
Suicide Risk Assessment: A thorough and systematic evaluation that is typically performed 
after suicide risk screening. A trained mental health clinician (e.g., a psychiatrist, social worker, 
or psychologist in an ED or PUCC setting) performs a detailed clinical assessment to confirm 
suspected suicide risk, to estimate the immediate danger, and to delineate treatment.  
Assessment takes into account chronic and acute risk factors, protective factors, and medical 
and mental health history. 
 
Suicidal Ideation (SI):  Thoughts of death or ending one’s life. Different types of SI include the 
following (in increasing level of severity):  
 
Passive SI: A wish to be dead or to go to sleep and not wake-up (C-SSRS Q1) 
Active SI: Actual thoughts of wanting to kill oneself 
(C-SSRS Q2) 
Suicide Method: Contemplation of one or more ways or means of 
ending their life, without formulating a specific plan  
(C-SSRS Q3) 
Suicidal Intent: Intention to act on suicidal thoughts or behaviors, with 
the specific goal to kill oneself or to die  
(C-SSRS Q4) 
Suicide Plan: Specific thoughts of converting a method to a plan, such 
as deciding on the timing, location, and/or preparations to end their life 
(e.g., gathering pills, acquiring a weapon, writing a suicide note, 
researching the location for a traumatic/deadly injury)  
(C-SSRS Q5) 
 
 
Suicide Attempt: A self-injurious behavior where a person specifically intends to die (C-SSRS 
Q6) 
 
Suicide: Death caused by self-injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of that behavior.   
(Note: The following terms are discouraged from use: “completed suicide”, “successful suicide”, 
and “failed suicide”. Preferred terms are “suicide” and “suicide attempt”.)  
 
Self-injurious behaviors:  Behaviors in which a person intentionally harms themselves, with or 
without intent to die (a patient’s intent to die must be specifically asked, or implied).  For 
example, patients may “self-harm” (e.g., cutting, burning, or punching oneself), without intent to 
die, as a way of attempting to cope with emotional distress or psychological pain.   
 
Suicidal behaviors: Self-injurious behavior with the intent to die.

 RISK OF SUICIDE     REFERENCE NO. 1306 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE: 07-01-25 PAGE 231 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
Safety Planning: Interventions made by healthcare personnel, first responders, or others, to 
reduce the patient’s risk of suicide or self-harm.  
 
5150 / 5585 (AKA “Hold”, “Psychiatric Hold”, “Mental Health Hold”, or “LPS Hold”): 
Refers to California Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) section 5150 et seq. which describes 
the legal standard for involuntary detainment and evaluation of a person who, as a result of a 
mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to themselves, or gravely disabled. “5150” 
refers to the code for adult patients, “5585” refers to the code for minors (under age 18). 
 
Danger to Self: The term used in CA WIC 5150 et seq, to define probable cause for detaining a 
patient involuntarily for the purpose of evaluation, who as a result of a mental illness poses a 
risk to themselves (e.g., has suicidal ideation or behavior).   
 
LPS-Evaluator: An individual that is authorized under CA WIC 5150 et seq. to evaluate and 
place a patient on a 5150/5585 hold application, such as all law enforcement (LE) personnel 
and clinicians who are LPS-authorized by the County Department of Mental Health. Examples 
include: Psychiatric Emergency Team (PET), Psychiatric Mobile Response Team (PMRT), 
Mental Evaluation Team (MET), Systemwide Mental Assessment Response Teams (SMART), 
or others). LPS refers to “Lanterman-Petris-Short”, the names of the original state legislators 
who authored the CA WIC 5150 et seq. code. 
 
LPS facility: Treatment facilities that are specifically designated by the county for mental health 
evaluation and treatment, approved by the State Department of Health Care Services, and 
licensed as a health facility as defined in the CA Health and Safety Code (subdivision (a) or (b) 
of Section 1250 or 1250.2).  
 
Against Medical Advice (AMA): A patient, or a legal representative of a patient, who has 
decision-making capacity and who refuses treatment and/or transport for an emergency 
medical condition as advised by EMS providers, physician on scene, and/or Base personnel.  
 
Decision-Making Capacity: The ability to understand the nature and consequences of 
proposed health care. This includes understanding the significant risks and benefits, and having 
the ability to make and communicate a decision regarding the proposed health care in the 
patient’s primary language, if feasible. A person has decision-making capacity if they are able 
to: 
• Communicate the need for treatment, the implications of receiving and of not 
receiving treatment, and alternative forms of treatment that are available, and 
• Relate the above information to their personal values, and then make and convey a 
decision. 
A person may lack decision-making capacity as follows:  
• Temporarily lost (e.g., due to unconsciousness, influence of mind-altering 
substances, mental illness, or cognitive impairment) 
• Permanently lost (e.g., due to irreversible coma, persistent vegetative state, 
untreatable brain injury, or dementia) 
• Never existed (i.e., due to profound neurodevelopmental or medical disorder), 
• Legally determined to lack capacity (i.e. persons who are deemed incompetent by a 
Court, or a person under conservatorship) 
 
9-8-8: The three digit emergency number for the 24/7 National Suicide and Crisis Lifeline that 
provides free and confidential emotional support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional 
distress.

 RISK OF SUICIDE     REFERENCE NO. 1306 
 
EFFECTIVE DATE: 07-01-25 PAGE 232 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Psychiatric emergencies (including those related to mental health and substance abuse) 
are emergent clinical conditions, and as such are best treated by EMS personnel who 
are trained, equipped, and experienced to evaluate and manage such patients. 
 
2. Suicide risk screening, through history taking and assessment, can be performed by 
EMS personnel during the evaluation of patients who express suicidal ideation or 
behaviors. Several suicide risk screening tools, which are evidence-based and validated 
in other settings, may be used to assist. 
 
3. CA WIC 5150 et seq. defines the situations when a patient may be involuntarily detained 
and transported on a psychiatric hold, and who is authorized to issue a psychiatric hold. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Evaluate the patient for medical conditions immediately if the patient has made a suicide 
attempt or is suspected of making a suicide attempt. Manage medical conditions with the 
appropriate treatment protocol based on provider impression. 
 
2. Evaluate primary psychiatric crises by obtaining relevant clinical history and managing 
per treatment protocol (TP 1209 or 1209-P, Behavioral/Psychiatric Crisis). 
 
3. Establish rapport with the patient to facilitate trust and open communication and to 
optimize the evaluation and screening of suicide risk. 
 
4. Inquire about the patient’s suicidal ideation and behaviors, including whether the patient 
has passive SI, active SI, contemplation of suicide method, intent to die by suicide, a 
plan to commit suicide, and/or suicide attempts. 
 
A. To assist with evaluating the level of suicide risk, a suicide risk screening tool 
such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (C-SSRS) can be used to 
administer standardized screening questions (MCG 1306.1). 
 
B. If using the C-SSRS, questions should be asked verbatim, all instructions should 
be followed, and attention paid to the specified time frames. 
 
5. Evaluate the reliability of information, especially in situations where a patient may be 
suspected of minimizing or evading questions about SI or suicidal behaviors.  
 
A. Obtain information from key third parties when feasible.   
 
B. Document if the patient lacks capacity or is unwilling to participate in the 
evaluation. 
 
6. When a patient has been evaluated by an authorized LPS-Evaluator regarding 
placement of a 5150/5585 hold, that evaluation shall generally take precedence in 
determining whether a patient can be transported involuntarily. 
A. Exceptions include when the EMS provider determines that the patient has a 
medical need that requires transport to a medical facility and lacks decision-
making capacity (e.g., need for evaluation for trauma or other emergency 
physical conditions).

1200 Table of Contents 
A. If concern for suicidal intent in persons that do not meet criteria for a 5150/5585 
hold as determined by an LPS evaluator, and refusing voluntary treatment or 
transport, EMS should contact base contact to discuss patient disposition. 
 
B. For recommendations regarding patient disposition, refer to MCG 1306.2. 
 
7. In situations where there may be disagreement with LE or an LPS-evaluator regarding 
the placement or non-placement of a 5150/5585 hold, and/or transport that cannot be 
resolved, the following steps should be taken: 
 
A. EMS provider shall contact higher authority (e.g., EMS Captain or Battalion 
Chief) to seek resolution, which may be facilitated by a call with the LE or LPS 
higher authorities.  
 
B. LE provider should contact higher authority (e.g., Field supervisor or Watch 
commander). 
 
C. LPS evaluators (such as PET, SMART, MET) should contact higher authority. 
 
D. Base Contact can be initiated to mediate discussion between LE and EMS, 
including discussion of suicide risk screening outcomes for both parties. 
 
E. In cases of continued disagreement, LE or LPS evaluator determination takes 
precedence as they are the legal authority for placement or non-placement of a 
5150/5585 hold. 
 
8. EMS clinicians can perform safety planning to help reduce the patient’s risk of suicide or 
self-harm with the following interventions: 
 
A. Establish mental health services: Provide the national suicide lifeline phone 
number (9-8-8), and recommend the patient call their mental health provider, or 
take steps to establish mental health care (e.g., LA County Department of Mental 
Health 800-854-7771, or contact their insurance provider) 
 
B. Help the patient identify support contacts: Identify a family member, friend or 
other trusted individual who they can reach out to for help and recommend that 
they be accompanied or supported in the short term. 
 
C. Reduce access to suicide means: Provide direction to the patient or key third 
parties (e.g., family, friends) to remove or secure any identified or potential 
means of suicide, especially firearms, knives, pills, or other toxins.   
 
Firearms can be secured through use of gun locks, storage lockers, or 
transferred to family or friend for safekeeping.  LE personnel can also be 
contacted to advise about securing firearms.   
 
D. Reduce the risk of alcohol or drugs: Recommend that the patient avoid use of 
alcohol or any other drugs, and/or take steps to limit their availability. 
 
9. Document decision-making and involved personnel on the ePCR including: 
 
A. All responding agencies on scene

Determination of patient disposition shall consider all information obtained during the field evaluation and 
should not rely solely on the results of a suicide risk screening, including: the patient’s medical and 
behavioral or psychiatric condition, information from key third parties, as well as any mental health 
evaluation performed by an LPS-Evaluator, if applicable.  
 
In general, patients will be transported to the MAR or PUCC when EMS is called to respond either on a 
voluntary basis or on a 5150 / 5585 hold.  For low risk patients with decision-making capacity refusing 
transport against medical advice, or in situations involving disagreement between different responders or 
agencies, standardized suicide risk screening is a useful tool to facilitate communication between EMS, 
LE and the Base Hospital.

REVISED:07-01-25 
SUPERSEDES: 10-01-22 
Medical Control Guideline: CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH AGITATION 
1200 Table of Contents 
DEFINITIONS: 
Agitation: A hyper-aroused state (ranging in severity from anxious and cooperative to violent 
and combative) in which the individual exhibits excessive, repeated, and purposeless motor or 
verbal behaviors (e.g., pacing, fidgeting, clenching fists or teeth, prolonged staring, picking at 
clothing or skin, responding to internal stimuli such as hallucinations, threatening or carrying out 
violent acts).  
 
Delirium: An acute change in mental state due to an underlying medical condition characterized 
by confusion, disorientation, reduced awareness of the environment, and disordered thinking. 
 
Autism Spectrum Disorder: A disorder diagnosed in childhood, but continuing into adulthood, 
with a wide range of severity involving difficulty with social communication and interaction, 
repetitive patterns of behavior, and narrowed interests or activities. Some patients have very 
little ability to communicate, or comprehend verbal and nonverbal communication, while others 
may communicate and are intelligent.  Individuals are often sensitive (fearful/reactive) to 
environmental stimulation and depend on routines. 
 
Bipolar Disorder: An episodic illness in which patients experience periods of elation or “high” 
mood (mania or hypomania), and periods of depression. Manic episodes are characterized by 
decreased sleep, lots of energy, rapid speech and ideas, impulsive and reckless decision-
making (e.g., buying expensive objects, quitting a job, going on sudden unplanned trips) and an 
inflated view of oneself (grandiosity).   
 
Delusion: A false belief that is firmly held despite objective and obvious contradictory proof or 
evidence.  Delusions can be dangerous when the patient has a fixed idea that causes them to 
act violently.  
 
Dementia: An illness generally diagnosed in older adults, associated with progressive cognitive 
decline including memory loss and an inability to carry out tasks or basic functions (i.e., driving, 
using a phone, dressing/grooming).  The condition ranges in severity with some patients having 
little ability to speak, communicate, to those with less severe forms may be able to communicate 
well and manage their own care needs.  
 
Major Depressive Disorder: An episodic illness in which a person feels profound sadness, a 
lack of enjoyment, and other symptoms that may include impairments in sleep, energy, appetite, 
motivation, concentration, and socialization.  These patients often feel hopeless and are 
especially likely to think about or try to commit suicide. 
 
Disorganized behaviors:  A set of behaviors or actions that do not appear to accomplish 
anything meaningful (e.g., laughing to self, lying motionless and unresponsive to people around 
them, pacing or repeatedly sitting/standing without any clear reason, staring at the wall, or 
object with a blank expression). They can be seen with a variety of conditions including 
psychosis, autism, dementia, and mania. 
 
Disorganized Speech: A speech pattern that is extremely difficult to follow, such as garbled or 
non-sense speech, telling a story that jumps illogically from one topic to the next, making up 
new words, or highly repetitive speech (e.g., muttering to self with repetitive phrases).

Hallucinations:  Patients experience sensing things that other people cannot hear, see, or 
smell (infrequent). Most commonly this means a patient is “hearing voices” or “seeing things”. 
This can be dangerous if the patient is experiencing hallucinations that command them to harm 
themselves, other people, or carry out dangerous acts. Hallucinations can be a symptom of 
psychosis or drug intoxication, but can be associated with other conditions like mania, 
depression, dementia and delirium. 
 
Iatrogenic escalation: Escalation of a patient’s agitated state caused by EMS / healthcare 
personnel either inadvertently, or deliberately, by acting in ways that the patient does not expect 
or desire (e.g., restricting a patient’s freedom to move (cornering the patient), taking away 
patient belongings or invalidating, confronting, arguing with, or intimidating a patient).   
 
Intellectual Disability: A range of disability from mild to severe, characterized by significant 
limitations in intellectual functioning (learning, reasoning, problem solving, planning) and 
adaptive behavior (everyday social skills like communication, and practical skills like living 
independently).  
 
Paranoia: A state of suspicion or mistrust of people or institutions, such as hospitals/healthcare 
personnel, law enforcement or security. 
 
Psychosis: A state where a person loses contact with reality.  Common diagnoses or terms of 
psychotic illness include: “Schizophrenia”, “Psychotic disorder”, “Acute psychotic episode”, 
“Schizoaffective disorder” (a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), “delusional 
disorder”.  The symptoms of a psychotic illness are commonly: hallucinations, delusions, 
paranoia and/or disorganized behaviors and speech.  
  
Self-injurious behaviors: Behaviors or violent acts directed at oneself, occurring in many 
psychiatric disorders which may include depression or bipolar disorder, psychosis, drug abuse, 
and personality disorder (patients are often trying to distract themselves from extreme emotional 
pain they feel).  (Also referred to as: Non-suicidal self-injury) 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Psychiatric emergencies, including those related to mental health and substance abuse, 
are medical emergencies, and as such are best treated by EMS personnel who are 
trained, equipped, and experienced to evaluate and manage medical patients. 
 
2. A proportion of prehospital psychiatric emergencies involve acute behavioral agitation, 
violence, threats of harm to self or others, or criminal activity. Such patients are best 
managed by an EMS and law enforcement (LE) co-response.  
 
3. The overarching goal in management of acute behavioral agitation is to help the patient 
regain control over their behaviors so that they can participate in their evaluation and 
treatment. 
 
4. EMS personnel should maintain the patient’s dignity to the extent possible, including use 
of the least restrictive method of restraint or intervention to facilitate clinical patient 
assessment, medically indicated treatment, and safe transport to a hospital. 
 
5. Agitation has varying presentations on a spectrum, ranging in severity from anxious and 
cooperative to violent and combative. The patient may not have the ability to understand 
the situation or the dangers of their behavior or comply with directions because they lack 
insight and/or self-awareness.

6. The potential causes of agitation are numerous and varied and can include medical 
and/or psychiatric and/or substance abuse conditions.  Agitation can also be unrelated to 
a medical/psychiatric condition, in such cases agitation may be used by a person 
“instrumentally” as a means of achieving a goal.   
 
7. Physical restraint and pharmacologic management of agitation when providing EMS 
care are primarily indicated to protect a patient, the public, and other EMS personnel 
from injury.  
 
8. The decision for EMS personnel to use pharmacologic intervention to treat agitation is a 
critical health care decision. (Note: “chemical restraint” is not a preferred terms). 
Medications with sedating effects administered during or after application of restraints 
has the potential to exacerbate acidosis and asphyxia. 
 
9. Persons who lack decision-making capacity, or unaccompanied minors, are assessed 
and treated with implied consent (Ref. No. 834 – Patient Refusal of Treatment/Transport 
and Treat and Release at Scene). 
 
10. LE officers, whenever available, should be involved in cases in which a patient poses a 
threat to themselves, the public, and/or EMS personnel.  
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Initial Approach to Scene Safety: 
A. Evaluation of the agitated patient should start from a safe and sensible distance (See 
MCGs 1307.1 and 1307.2).  
 
B. If EMS personnel are in danger of harm, they should retreat to a safe location and 
await the arrival of LE. 
i. Safety is paramount and at no time should EMS personnel jeopardize 
their safety by engaging with an agitated patient unless they feel that they 
have the knowledge, tools, and skills to do so. 
 
C. The first EMS and/or LE responders should organize their approach by identifying a 
lead who is responsible for communicating with the patient and coordinating the 
actions of the rest of the team. 
 
D. If there is no safe option for retreat, EMS personnel who are being physically 
attacked may defend themselves as permitted by local law. EMS personnel should 
not show aggression or retaliate against the patient. 
 
E. The goals of EMS care are to determine whether the patient is a candidate for verbal 
de-escalation (the preferred first step in managing agitation), if physical restraint is 
indicated, if pharmacologic intervention is indicated, and ultimately to provide an 
assessment for acute medical and psychiatric conditions. 
 
F. The flowchart in MCG 1307.1 describes the initial approach to the scene of an 
agitated patient. 
 
 
2. Verbal De-escalation: 
 
 

SUBJECT:  CARE OF THE PATIENT WITH AGITATION REFERENCE NO. 1307 
 
REVISED: 07-01-25 PAGE 240 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
 
A. All EMS personnel shall be trained, capable, and competent in verbal de-escalation 
techniques, (e.g., using the “ERASER” mnemonic, see MCG 1307.2). 
 
B. The use of appropriate de-escalation techniques should take precedence and be 
attempted prior to physical restraint and/or administration of pharmacologic 
management, whenever possible and clinically appropriate. 
 
C. EMS personnel should not directly question or confront a patient’s psychotic 
symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, or behaviors) as it may worsen 
the patient’s agitation.  
 
D. EMS personnel should remain self-aware and not allow themselves to react to 
provocative patients because this can lead to iatrogenic escalation of agitation.  
 
3. Assessment of Agitation: 
 
A. EMS personnel shall attempt to perform an appropriate patient assessment to 
identify and manage clinical conditions that may be contributing to a patient’s 
agitated, combative, or violent behavior.  The table in MCG 1307.3 describes 
potential clinical scenarios where a patient presents with agitation and provides 
guidance on use of verbal de-escalation. 
 
4. Pharmacologic management may be required for the safety of the patient, EMS 
personnel and/or public when verbal de-escalation techniques are ineffective (TP 1209 
or 1209-P,Behavioral/Psychiatric Crisis).  
 
A. Apnea may occur rapidly and without warning after pharmacologic intervention. 
 
B. Patient monitoring should be implemented any time parenteral pharmacologic 
intervention is performed. Resuscitation and monitoring equipment, including oxygen 
and bag valve mask, should be positioned near the patient and readily accessible 
prior to proceeding with sedation. Monitoring of pulse oximetry, cardiac rhythm, and 
capnography (when available) should be implemented as soon as possible and prior 
to initiation of transport.  
 
C. Monitoring is not required for agitated patients who are cooperative and voluntarily 
accept oral medications.  
 
5. Use of Restraints: 
 
A. If determined that the patient is not an appropriate candidate for verbal de-escalation 
(i.e., after failed attempts at verbal de-escalation, or acute medical situation requires 
immediate intervention) or when managing a patient who re-escalates to agitated 
behavior after verbal de-escalation, physical restraint may be required in conjunction 
with pharmacologic management (Ref. No. 838, Application of Patient Restraints).  
 
6. Co-Response with Law Enforcement: 
 
A. At all times, EMS personnel should act as an advocate for the safety, medical 
monitoring, and clinical care of the patient.

B. In some situations, it may be necessary for LE to apply restraint techniques or 
interventions (e.g., handcuffs or flex cuffs, herein referred to as LE restraint). 
a. Patients requiring ongoing care and/or EMS transport that are in LE restraints 
shall be managed in accordance with Ref. No. 838, Application of Patient 
Restraints, with preference for discontinuing LE restraint in favor of EMS 
approved restraint interventions when appropriate. 
 
C. Patients who are in LE custody or who are under arrest must always have a LE 
officer present or immediately available during EMS transport.

Medical Control Guideline: VERBAL DE-ESCALATION (ERASER MNEMONIC) 
1200 Table of Contents 
E Eyeball the 
patient 
Evaluate the patient from a safe distance.  Survey the scene and ask about 
weapons or other features that make the scene unsafe.  Decide if Law 
Enforcement (LE) is necessary (if in doubt err on the side of caution).  Are 
there signs that the patient will not respond to verbal de-escalation?  
R Respect the 
Patient’s Space   
Patients may escalate when there is intrusion into the personal space.  
EMS personnel should maintain a respectful distance while being aware of 
escape routes should the patient become violent.  
A A single member 
of EMS personnel 
does the talking 
and builds 
rapport 
Establishing rapport is critical.  With multiple EMS personnel on the scene, 
a single individual should be charged with talking to the patient.  The EMS 
personnel charged with this task must remain neutral, and not become 
“emotionally involved” in the patient (such as becoming angry, irritated, or 
frightened of the patient).   
• State your name and position, offer your help.   
• Be genuine and honest.   
• Use a calm, reassuring, and helpful voice, and a neutral expression.  
Be concise in your questions, statements, or instructions.  
• Give the patient time to respond. 
S Sensible 
Listening 
 
Often patients want to be heard, and people who are upset or confused 
generally want a way to resolve the issue. Help them find a “way out” if it is 
reasonable.  Try to understand what the patient wants.  Show a willingness 
to calmly listen to the patient, without necessarily reacting to demands.   
This step can result in re-escalation of agitation if  EMS personnel becomes 
emotionally reactive, angry, frightened, or frustrated.  Other EMS personnel 
may need to step in and continue if this happens. 
E Establish 
expectations and 
set boundaries 
 
Boundaries should be set with the patient about behavior that will not be 
tolerated, consequences of actions, and what the patient is likely to expect.  
It is important to be clear but avoid using language that can sound 
intimidating or threatening. 
• For example, “You may not threaten people, it is our job to make 
sure everyone stays safe.”  “We need to make sure that you are ok, 
can we check your vitals and ask you some questions.”  
“Unfortunately, we are worried that you cannot make informed 
medical decisions because you are intoxicated.  We are going to 
take you to the hospital so you can be treated for your injuries.”   
• Give specific instructions such as “can you please sit down so we 
can talk”, “can you put down your bag”.   Avoid generic directives 
like “calm down” or “relax”.   
• Provide a clear warning to the patient about the need to ensure the 
safety of both the patient and EMS personnel and public.  Warn that 
restraint, or medications will be given as necessary, but as a last 
resort.   
R Reasonable 
choices are given 
to the patient 
By retaining some degree of control, many patients will comply with 
direction if given reasonable choices.  For example, EMS personnel could 
say, “would you like to walk over to the ambulance and sit on the bed 
inside, or do you prefer we bring the bed over here for you to sit on?”

           1200 Table of Contents 
DEFINITION 
 
Agitation: A hyper-aroused state (ranging in severity from anxious and cooperative to violent and 
combative) in which the individual exhibits excessive, repeated, and purposeless motor or verbal 
behaviors (e.g., pacing, fidgeting, clenching fists or teeth, prolonged staring, picking at clothing or skin, 
responding to internal stimuli such as hallucinations, threatening or carrying out violent acts).  
 
Decision-Making Capacity: The ability to understand the nature and consequences of proposed health 
care. This includes understanding the significant risks and benefits and having the ability to make and 
communicate a decision regarding the proposed health care in the patient’s primary language, if feasible. 
A person has decision-making capacity if they are able to:  
• Communicate the need for treatment, the implications of receiving and of not receiving treatment, 
and alternative forms of treatment that are available, and  
• Relate the above information to their personal values, and then make and convey a decision.  
 
The lack of decision-making capacity may be:  
• Temporarily lost (e.g., due to unconsciousness, influence of mind-altering substances, mental 
illness, or cognitive impairment)  
• Permanently lost (e.g., due to irreversible coma, persistent vegetative state, untreatable brain 
injury, or dementia) 
• Never existed (i.e., due to profound neurodevelopmental disorder, those who are deemed by the 
Court as incompetent or a person under conservatorship) 
 
Minor: A person less than eighteen years of age. 
 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. EMS and Law Enforcement often co-respond to the scene when there is an agitated patient 
perceived to pose risk to themself and/or others. 
 
2. EMS focus is on the duty to the patient, whereas Law Enforcement has a duty to the public. 
This may result in differences in the approach to scene management. 
 
3. Each situation is unique and dynamic such that no guideline can be comprehensive or 
specific. The flow diagram below represents a general approach, but must be adapted to the 
individual circumstances of the response. 
 
4. Early, clear and open communication will facilitate arriving at the best possible outcome for 
the person. The conflict resolution pathway (Guideline #4) should be employed whenever 
there is not full agreement between EMS and Law Enforcement on whether to remain 
engaged. 
 
5. The decision for Law Enforcement to engage, and/or to apply a 5150 or 5585, will be 
according to their policies, procedures, and the law. While Law Enforcement will

ultimately determine if there is an immediate threat, engagement should be a consensus-
driven decision based on the assessment of EMS and Law Enforcement on scene. For cases 
where there is ongoing disagreement and a successful resolution cannot be reached on 
scene, an after action review shall be undertaken at a later agreed upon date, in collaboration 
with both agencies. 
 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Refer to the flow diagram below for guidance. 
 
2. When the agitated person is a minor, apply the guidelines with the following caveats: 
 
a. If the minor is alone, the general approach will be to engage. 
b. If the minor is in the care of a parent or legal guardian, the principles of capacity 
assessment are applied to that parent or legal guardian, with consideration for how 
they can assist in de-escalating the situation and provide an alternative to 
engagement. 
c. Involve the Department of Child and Family Services as appropriate, 
https://dcfs.lacounty.gov/, 800-540-4000. 
d. Refer also to Ref. No. 832, Treatment/Transport of Minors. 
 
3. Consider the following Mental Health Resources: 
 
a. Request response of local jurisdictional resources as available.  
b. Request a Crisis Response Team from the Department of Mental Health Access 
Center 24/7 Contact Line: 800-854-7771. 
c. For any patient left on scene, inform the patient of the ‘988’ hotline, which provides 
telemedicine mental health resources.  
 
4. For situations where Law Enforcement decision is to disengage or defer and EMS remains 
concerned about immediate risk to the patient and/or others, the following communication 
strategy should be employed in a stepwise fashion until a final solution is agreed upon: 
 
a. The highest ranking EMS and Law Enforcement personnel on scene discuss their 
rationale for the decision to engage versus disengage. 
b. Mental health resources are identified and requested to the scene to provide 
alternative methods for de-escalation and management. Consider contacting the Base 
Hospital for further guidance on resources and strategies. 
c. If not already on scene, the EMS and Law Enforcement supervisors are requested to 
the scene and discuss face-to-face. 
d. The EMS supervisor speaks with the Law Enforcement Watch Commander. 
e. If no resolution is achieved, EMS shall defer to Law Enforcement and not engage on 
their own if there is a perceived risk to EMS personnel and/or the patient.  
 
5. Document decision-making and involved personnel on the ePCR including: 
a. All responding agencies on scene  
b. EMS assessment

Medical Control Guideline: CARDIAC MONITORING / 12 –LEAD ECG 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Continuous cardiac monitoring is a key component of a thorough patient assessment 
and treatment in the prehospital setting. 
 
2. Continuous observation of a patient’s cardiac rhythm ensures early identification of 
potentially lethal dysrhythmias and provides other information about the patient’s 
condition to guide treatment and destination decisions. 
 
3. The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in the prehospital care setting plays a key role in 
identifying STEMI and determining the most appropriate treatment and destination for 
patients with Chest Pain - Suspected Cardiac and STEMI. 
 
4. Prehospital identification and communication of ST-elevation myocardial infarction 
(STEMI) reduces critical “door-to-intervention” times for STEMI patients and saves lives. 
 
5. When a 12-lead ECG is indicated, it should be obtained as early as possible in the 
assessment. 
 
6. A good quality 12-lead ECG is a key component of a thorough patient assessment.  A 
good quality 12-lead ECG includes the presence of all 12-leads on the ECG tracing and 
absence of artifacts and/or wavy baseline. 
 
7. Complete and accurate ECG documentation is essential for patient care and quality 
improvement purposes. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Once ongoing cardiac monitoring is determined to be necessary, observe the rhythm 
continuously and leave the monitor in place until care has been transferred to 
appropriate hospital personnel or as directed by the base hospital. 
 
2. Document the ECG interpretation on the appropriate section in the EMS Report Form or 
Electronic Patient Care Report (ePCR). If a dysrhythmia is identified, provide an ECG 
strip labeled with the patient’s name, sequence number, date and time to the receiving 
facility (in either paper or electronic format) as part of the patient's prehospital medical 
record.  Retain a copy per the provider agency’s departmental policy. 
 
3. Perform a prehospital 12-lead ECG on patients with any of the following: 
a. Chest pain or discomfort in all patients ≥35 years or any suspected cardiac etiology 
b. Dysrhythmia (in order to capture rhythm and possible etiology) 
c. Syncope in all patients ≥35 years or any suspected cardiac etiology 
d. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after a cardiac arrest 
e. Other symptoms with paramedic suspicion of cardiac etiology (e.g., non-traumatic 
shoulder, jaw or upper arm pain, shortness of breath, epigastric pain)

f. Vague or unexplained symptoms (e.g. general weakness, lightheadedness, nausea, 
malaise) in patients at high risk of acute cardiac ischemia (e.g. coronary artery 
disease, myocardial infarction, elderly diabetic patients, stroke, peripheral vascular 
disease)  
 
4. To obtain a good quality ECG: 
a. Minimize electrode exposure to air prior to use; ideally they should be removed from 
the packaging immediately before application 
b. Ensure that all electrodes are in good contact with the patient’s skin (wipe sweat with 
dry towel before applying and shave hair if necessary) 
c. Place electrodes according to the diagram in order to observe all aspects of the left 
heart 
d. For female patients or obese patients of either gender, electrodes should be 
attached in the same anatomic location; this may require placement on the breast if 
lifting the breast places the electrodes too low in the chest 
e. Attach the limb leads to the extremities (distal to the deltoid and to the inguinal line) 
f. Stabilize the ECG fan-out (i.e., cable management / junction point) on the patient 
g. Lay the patient supine or as recumbent as possible 
h. Instruct the patient relax, remain still, and close their eyes prior to acquisition 
i. Obtain the ECG prior to transport so that the ambulance is not in motion 
j. Leave the electrodes and leads in place for continuous monitoring and repeat ECGs 
 
5. Treat symptoms and rhythms identified according to applicable treatment protocols. 
 
6. Maintain the patient’s privacy and dignity while performing the 12-lead ECG. 
 
7. For patients in which at least two of the following are true: 
 
a. Paramedic interpretation of the ECG is STEMI. The 12-lead ECG tracing has greater 
than 1mm ST-segment elevation in 2 or more contiguous leads 
b. The software interpretation indicates “ST Elevation Acute MI” or “STEMI”. 
c. The patient’s clinical condition is consistent with STEMI   
 
Transmit the ECG tracing to the SRC receiving the patient. Discuss with receiving SRC 
ED physician. Transport the patient to the closest SRC. 
 
8. For software interpretations of STEMI for which the paramedic disagrees, due to the 
patient’s clinical presentation and paramedic ECG interpretation, paramedics should 
contact the Base Hospital for online medical direction, to discuss destination decision. 
 
9. Report to the SRC physician and/or Base Hospital shall include the software 
interpretation, paramedic interpretation, any quality issues, the rate on the ECG, whether 
the QRS is wide or narrow, and whether there is a paced rhythm. Document this 
information on the appropriate prehospital care record. 
 
10. Provide prehospital 12-lead ECGs that are labeled with the patient’s name, sequence 
number, date and time to the receiving facility (in either paper or electronic format) as 
part of the patient's prehospital medical record.

PRINCIPLES:  
1. Correct dosing of medications based on weight in kilograms is a safety concern for delivery of 
medications to children and adults in the prehospital setting. 
 
2. To optimize safety in dosing medications for children and adults, a standard formulary has 
been created. This Color Code Drug Doses medical control guideline pre-calculates all 
doses based on kilogram weight for children and an adult dose including maximum dose is 
delineated. 
 
3. EMS provider agencies shall procure medications and stock approved Assessment and ALS 
Units in accordance with the drug formulation specified in this medical control guideline. 
 
4. The Color Code Drug Doses and the Treatment Protocols shall be used to determine drug 
doses. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
1. EMS providers shall utilize a length-based resuscitation tape (i.e., Broselow
TM
) to determine 
weight in kilograms and color code of children less than or equal to 14 years of age. 
 
2. EMS providers shall use this guideline to determine dose of medication for children 3 to 36 
kilograms. Documentation of dose will be in mgs and in mLs. 
 
3. EMS providers contacting the base hospital shall report and document the appropriate color 
code and weight in kilograms utilizing a length-based resuscitation tape (i.e., Broselow
TM
). 
 
4. Base hospital personnel shall use this guideline to order dose of medication for children 3 to 
36 kilograms; all doses will be given in mg and mLs. 
 
5. Adult dosing will be used for children who are measured to be longer than the length-based 
resuscitation tape.

Medical Control Guideline:  CONDUCTED ELECTRICAL WEAPON 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLE: 
 
1. Safety is the first priority in any situation involving the use of a conducted 
electrical weapon (CEW), trade name Taser
®
. Law enforcement should secure 
the scene and ensure the safety of EMS personnel before the patient is 
assessed or treated. 
 
2. Aggressive or violent behavior may be symptomatic of medical conditions such as 
head trauma, alcohol or drug related problems, metabolic disorders, stress or 
psychiatric problems. 
 
3. Concurrent intoxication with cocaine, methamphetamine, phencyclidine (PCP), or 
other stimulants is common among those subdued by law enforcement with 
electrical weapons. 
 
4. Physical assessment should include evaluation for any potential injury that may 
have occurred as a result of the use of a CEW. 
 
5. Paramedics cannot medically clear CEW patients for booking by law enforcement. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Do not remove CEW barbs, probes or darts unless they interfere with the 
patient’s airway, for life-saving measures, or the individual cannot be safely 
transported with the barbs in place. 
 
2. Complete a thorough physical assessment for all patients who have sustained the 
use of a CEW. 
 
3. Maintain a high index of suspicion for traumatic injuries (i.e., sustained from 
fall) as a result of the deployment and discharge of the CEW. 
 
4. Paramedics shall make Base Hospital Contact and transport in accordance 
with the protocol appropriate for the Provider Impression. For isolated CEW 
injury, the appropriate Provider Impression is Traumatic Injury. 
 
5. Documentation on the Patient Care Report.

Medical Control Guideline: CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is a non-invasive, mechanical ventilatory 
support system. It is effective in treating patients with shortness of breath by decreasing 
work of breathing, improving pulmonary gas exchange and improving pulmonary 
compliance.  CPAP decreases the need for endotracheal intubation, reduces intensive 
care unit admissions, and shortens hospital length of stay. 
 
2. CPAP is approved for patients with moderate-to-severe respiratory distress who meet 
ALL of the following criteria: 
a. Greater than the length of the length-based resuscitation tape (i.e. Broselow tm) 
b. Awake  
c. Cooperative 
d. Able to follow commands 
 
3. Contraindications to CPAP include:  
a. Respiratory or cardiac arrest 
b. Inability to protect airway  
c. Cannot follow basic commands 
d. Hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg) 
e. Tracheostomy 
f. Vomiting 
g. Suspected pneumothorax 
h. Respiratory distress due to traumatic injury 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Explain the procedure to the patient prior to starting CPAP. Patient understanding and 
cooperation are critical to successful treatment.  
 
2. Titrate CPAP pressure per manufacturer’s guidelines to improvement of symptoms as 
tolerated by patient.  Improvement is demonstrated by a decrease in respiratory distress, 
improvement in vital signs, and/or an increase in oxygen saturation.  
 
3. Continuously monitor vital signs, including oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon 
dioxide, to ensure adequate ventilation and hemodynamic stability. Document findings at 
least every five minutes throughout the treatment until the transfer of care.   
 
4. If the patient’s condition worsens or is unable to tolerate CPAP, discontinue CPAP and 
continue to supplement oxygen per MCG 1302. Be prepared to assist ventilations with a 
bag mask as indicated. 
 
5. Maintain CPAP for patients who tolerate treatment until care is assumed by the receiving 
facility. 
 
6. Document the patient’s response to therapy, CPAP pressure (initial and at transfer of 
care), any adverse event while on CPAP, and rationale if CPAP is discontinued prior to 
the transfer of care.

Prehospital Considerations 
• Cannulate a large proximal vein with an 18-20g catheter. Use IV port closest to patient and immediately 
flush with 10mL Normal Saline to ensure rapid administration of drug. 
• Run a 6 second ECG strip before, during and after drug administration. 
• Patients usually have a 10 second period of escape beats or asystole before the sinus node starts up 
again. This is perceived as a feeling of impending death and can be extremely frightening for patients. 
• If the wide-complex tachycardia is ventricular in origin, Adenosine is highly unlikely to cause successful 
cardioversion.

Epinephrine (1mg/mL) 0.01mg/kg IM dose per MCG 1309, repeat every 10 min prn x2, maximum 3 total doses 
prior to Base contact 
 
Mechanism of Action 
A naturally occurring catecholamine. Acts directly on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. It is the most 
potent activator of alpha receptors vasoconstricting the aorta and peripheral vasculature. Beta 1 stimulation 
increases inotropy, chronotropy, and AV conduction. Beta 2 stimulation causes bronchial smooth muscle 
relaxation and vasodilation to internal organs and skeletal muscles. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is < 2 min IV, 1-3 min IM; duration is 5-10 min IV, 20-30 min IM 
 
Contraindications 
None 
 
Interactions 
Can be partially deactivated by highly alkaline solutions, such as sodium bicarbonate. 
 
Adverse Effects 
Anxiety 
CVA or MI (rare, IV only) 
Hypertension 
Palpitations 
Tachydysrhythmias 
Tremors 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Inadvertent IV injection of usual IM formulation and dose constitutes a 10-fold overdose that can result

Mechanism of Action 
Narcotic agonist-analgesic of opiate receptors; inhibits ascending pain pathways thus altering response to 
pain, increases pain threshold, produces analgesia, respiratory depression and sedation 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is immediate; peak in 3-5 min; duration is 30-60 min 
 
Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity 
Pregnant patients in labor 
 
Interactions 
Alcohol and other central nervous system depressants potentiate its effect 
 
Adverse Effects 
Chest wall stiffness / Chest wall pain 
Delirium / Convulsions (uncommon) 
Muscle stiffness 
Nausea and vomiting (most common) 
Respiratory depression 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Monitor respiratory status. Respiratory depression, when it occurs, may last longer than the analgesic 
effect. 
• Administer slowly to decrease likelihood of chest stiffness, which can be life threatening. 
• Onset of fentanyl is quicker, and duration of action is shorter as compared to morphine. Unlike 
morphine, fentanyl does not cause histamine release. Therefore, it is unlikely to cause hypotension in 
therapeutic dosages. 
• Naloxone can be used for reversal if needed.

≥ 1 year of age 1.0mL (1mg/mL) IM, may repeat in x1 in 20 min prn 
 
Mechanism of Action 
A hormone naturally produced by pancreatic alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans. Causes breakdown of 
glycogen (stored in the liver) to glucose and inhibits the synthesis of glycogen from glucose. The combined 
actions increase the blood levels of glucose. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is 5-20 min; duration is 1-1.5 hr 
 
Contraindications 
In patients with known insulinoma (insulin-secreting tumor), glucagon will produce worsening hypoglycemia 
 
Interactions 
None 
 
Adverse Effects 
Hypotension 
Nausea and vomiting 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Use mixture immediately after reconstitution of dry powder and provided solution. 
• Patient usually awakens from hypoglycemic coma 5-20 min after glucagon injection. PO carbohydrates 
should be given as soon as possible after patient regains consciousness. 
• Symptoms such as headache, nausea and weakness may persist after recovery from hypoglycemic 
reaction. 
• Glucagon is effective only if there are glycogen stores in the liver. Therefore, it is unlikely to be effective 
in patients with severe malnutrition, adrenal insufficiency or young infants.

Prehospital Considerations 
• Give in small increments until the desired narcotic reversal is achieved (respiratory rate 12 and 
adequate tidal volume). 
• Duration of action of some narcotics may exceed that of naloxone; therefore, patient must be closely 
observed for need for repeat doses. 
• Naloxone causes acute withdrawal symptoms and can precipitate acute pulmonary edema when given 
in large boluses to narcotic addicts. Use only enough to reverse respiratory depression. 
• Naloxone is not indicated in cardiac arrest though can be given after ROSC if narcotic overdose 
suspected. 
• Higher dose pre-packaged nasal spray should not be used in the newborn/neonate due to potential risk 
to precipitate withdrawal.

administration and determine subsequent dose base on SBP as listed above. Hold if SBP 
< 100mmHg 
Pediatric Dose 
Not recommended for pediatric administration 
 
Mechanism of Action 
Organic nitrate which causes systemic venous dilatation, decreasing preload. Cellular mechanism: nitrate 
enters vascular smooth muscle and is converted to nitric oxide leading to vasodilation. Relaxes smooth 
muscle via dose-dependent dilation of arterial and venous beds to reduce both preload and afterload, and 
myocardial oxygen demand. Also improves coronary collateral circulation. Lowers BP, increases heart rate 
and occasional paradoxical bradycardia. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is 1-3 min SL or TM; duration is 20-30 min 
 
Contraindications 
Use of sexually enhancing/erectile dysfunction medications such as sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil within 
the past 48 hours 
Hypotension with SBP < 100mmHg 
Suspected cardiac tamponade 
 
Interactions 
Alcohol, opiates and antihypertensive agents may compound hypotensive effects. Patients taking sexually 
enhancing/erectile dysfunction medications are at risk for severe, prolonged hypotension leading to death.

Mechanism of Action 
Oxygen is a tasteless, odorless gas transported by hemoglobin in the blood to organ tissues. It is required 
for the breakdown of glucose into a useable energy form (aerobic metabolism). Therapeutic oxygen 
administration increases the oxygen concentration in the alveoli, which in turn increases the oxygen 
saturation of available hemoglobin.

    Ref. No. 1318 
 
 
REVISED: 07-01-25 PAGE 303 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Some patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are refractory to conventional 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation have improved outcomes if extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO) is used to provide ongoing resuscitation support. ECMO treatment 
for patient in cardiac arrest is called extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) 
or extracorporeal life support (ECLS). 
2. Currently it is not known exactly which patients are able to benefit from ECPR but certain 
patients including patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia 
(rVF/VT) cardiac arrest have been shown to have up to 30% improved survival. 
 
3. For all patients with OHCA, management should be conducted to minimize interruptions in 
chest compressions and prioritize standard therapies, including chest compressions and 
defibrillation for shockable rhythms, and early epinephrine for non-shockable rhythms. 
4. While usual protocols emphasize prolonged on scene resuscitation for rVF/VT, patients for 
whom ECPR is indicated and a mechanical compression device (MCD) is available to 
maintain quality chest compression during transport should be transported as soon as 
possible once ECPR criteria are met in order to minimize the low-flow time prior to 
cannulation for ECPR. Goal scene time is no more than 15 minutes. 
 
5. Patients for whom there is a significant delay in transport due to extrication challenges or 
lack of MCD availability should be resuscitated on scene to achieve return of 
spontaneous circulation (ROSC) since ECPR is unlikely to be initiated in patients more 
than 60 minutes after cardiac arrest onset. 
 
6. Patients transported with ongoing resuscitation should have an advanced airway  in 
place to  ensure adequate ventilations during movement and transport, and an 
Impedance Threshold Device (ITD) attached when available. 
7. Epinephrine beyond 3 doses is associated with worse outcomes in patients with 
rVF/VT.  Additional  epinephrine  for  patients  who re-arrest  into  a non-shockable 
rhythm should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
 
8. Contact directly with the ECPR Receiving Center Base facilitates clear communication 
and reduces delays. MICNs and Base physicians should be familiar with the differences 
in the field management priorities for these patients. 
 
9. In general, patients for whom contact is made with a non-ECPR SRC Base for medical 
direction should not be redirected to an ECPR Receiving Center, since the delay will 
result in poor ECPR candidacy; in such cases, medical direction should focus on 
optimizing the resuscitation to achieve ROSC. 
 
10. When the ECPR Receiving Center is the closest accessible SRC, additional patients who 
do not meet the ECPR criteria for immediate transport may be considered for ECPR on a 
case-by-case basis if the ECMO team feels the patient could benefit. Early contact with 
the ECPR SRC Base should be made in these cases to determine if early transport prior 
to ROSC is advisable.

GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Paramedics shall identify patients who meet ECPR criteria and manage the patient per TP 
1210, Cardiac Arrest while prioritizing transport. 
 
2. Scene time for ECPR eligible patients should be limited to ≤15 minutes. 
 
3. A maximum of 3 doses of epinephrine (total of 3mg) is indicated during the resuscitation. 
Push- dose epinephrine is appropriate and should be administered after ROSC to 
prevent re-arrest when indicated. 
 
4. An advanced airway should be inserted as soon as feasible to facilitate ventilations 
during transport. 
5. Communication with the ECPR Receiving Center Base should occur immediately after 
transport is initiated. Base will ensure the hospital is prepared to receive the patient and 
can activate the ECMO team. 
6. The ECPR Receiving Center Base will confirm priorities including chest compressions via 
MCD, defibrillations, and advanced airway with capnography monitoring, and will activate 
the ECMO team when indicated prior to patient arrival.

Medical Control Guideline:  LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLE: 
 
1. Evaluation and documentation of the patient’s level of consciousness are 
key components of a thorough patient assessment. 
 
2. The patient’s baseline level of consciousness should be taken into consideration 
when evaluating whether the altered level of consciousness (ALOC) finding 
represents an acute change or is normal for the patient. 
 
3. Signs and symptoms of ALOC may present as disorientation to person, place or time; 
confusion; lethargy; impaired cognition; coma; inappropriate aggressiveness; or 
hostility. These findings should alert EMS personnel to the possibility that the patient 
may have a serious underlying medical condition. 
 
4. If the patient has ALOC, evaluation of past medical history, including history of ALOC 
reported by patient or family members, may provide clues to the cause of the patient’s 
ALOC. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Assess orientation by asking the patient the following: 
a. Name 
b. Where they live/where they are 
c. Day of week/year/time of day 
Patients unable to reasonably answer one or more of the above shall be considered 
to have ALOC. 
 
2. Utilize the appropriate Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) to assess the neurological status 
of all patients. Report and document the GCS in the following order: eye opening, 
verbal response, and motor response.

NOTE: For patients unable to communicate or patients with a language barrier, 
estimate appropriateness of motor response, obedience, and verbal response by 
consulting with the family and/or primary caregiver(s), if applicable. 
 
3. If the patient has ALOC consider possible causes using AEIOU-TIPS: 
A – Alcohol, abuse of substances 
E – Electrolytes 
 I – Infection 
O –  Oxygen (hypoxia), overdose 
U – Uremia 
T – Trauma, tumor, child maltreatment, toxic substance (or adverse reactions to 
medications 
 I – Insulin (hypoglycemia) 
P – Poisoning, Psych 
S – Seizures, Sepsis, Stroke, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage 
 
4. Perform an on scene assessment, obtain history from caregivers including baseline 
functional status, and complete physical assessment including neurological exam to 
evaluate patient for signs of stroke. 
 
5. Point of care testing should include pulse oximetry, glucose testing, and cardiac 
monitoring to include 12-lead ECG in patients with suspected cardiac ischemia or 
dysrhythmia.

Medical Control Guideline:  MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DEVICES 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. A Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) device is an implanted device that is used to 
partially or completely replace the function of a failing heart in adults and children. MCS 
devices may be used as a bridge to transplant or as destination therapy for those who 
are not transplant candidates.   
 
2. There are several types of MCS devices.  A ventricular assist device (VAD) can support 
the function of the left ventricle with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), the right 
ventricle (RVAD), or both ventricles (biventricular device). A total artificial heart (TAH) 
replaces the heart itself. The most common device is currently a LVAD.   
 
3. MCS patients have a coordinator available 24 hours a day who will provide direction on 
managing the device. Contact information for the device coordinator may be located on 
the device, refrigerator, medical-alert bracelet or on a card in the patient’s wallet. 
 
4. The patient and family members receive extensive training on their specific MCS device 
and should be utilized in the care of the patient. 
 
5. Many MCS device patients are on anticoagulants and prone to bleeding. 
 
6. MCS device patients are preload dependent and may be harmed by vasodilators (e.g., 
nitrates). 
 
7. Most MCS device patient emergencies will NOT be related to malfunction of the device. 
Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD) 
 
8. Due to the continuous (non-pulsatile) flow of VAD devices, vital signs such as blood 
pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry are unobtainable or unreliable and perfusion 
status should be based on the clinical exam. Capnography will read accurately and can 
provide valuable information on the patient’s perfusion status.   
 
9. All VAD patients can be defibrillated and cardioverted, if indicated.   
 
10. Chest compressions may dislodge the internal VAD tubes from the heart, causing the 
patient to bleed into the thoracic and/or abdominal cavities; however, chest compression 
can be performed if needed on VAD patients.   
Total Artificial Heart (TAH) 
11. The TAH produces pulsatile flow with a palpable pulse and measurable blood pressure.  
 
12. TAH patients cannot be defibrillated or cardioverted and do not produce an ECG tracing. 
 
13. Systolic hypertension increases afterload and may lead to pulmonary edema. In this 
situation, careful administration of vasodilators may be considered. 
  

SUBJECT:  MECHANICAL CIRCULATORY SUPPORT DEVICES REFERENCE NO. 1325 
 
REVISED: 09-01-22 PAGE 309 OF 447
  
1200 Table of Contents 
14. Chest compressions should not be performed on TAH patients because non-
compressible mechanical chambers have replaced the ventricles. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. If there is concern for device malfunction, call the MCS device coordinator directly to 
assist with troubleshooting. 
 
2. Mechanical Circulatory Device resources are available 24/7 at the following institutions: 
 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center – (310) 887-0599 
Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center – (310) 825-6301, pager #93544 
Keck Hospital of USC – (323) 442-6077 
 
3. When a MCS patient is experiencing signs and symptoms related to the device, every 
effort should be made to transport the patient to their MCS hospital. Allow the family 
member or caregiver to ride with the patient if treatment and space permit. 
 
4. If the MCS coordinator is not reachable and/or additional orders are required, contact the 
Base hospital. 
 
5. Treat MCS patients by the appropriate treatment protocol, based on your provider 
impression. 
 
6. Attempt to locate an Advanced Healthcare Directive and/or a Physician Orders for Life-
sustaining Therapy (POLST). Most MCS device patients have made end-of-life care 
decisions. 
 
7. Given that MCS devices are preload dependent, administer fluids early when directed by 
the Treatment Protocol.   
 
8. All of the patient’s MCS device equipment must accompany them to the hospital. Make 
sure all equipment is safely secured prior to transport to ensure that the driveline is not 
pulled or cut during transport. Spinal motion restriction and/or splinting may be modified 
to protect the integrity of the MCS device equipment. 
 
Ventricular Assist Devices (VAD) 
 
9. Do not administer nitroglycerin; give only aspirin and morphine or fentanyl when treating 
chest pain suspected cardiac or STEMI. 
 
10. Utilize clinical parameters for patient assessment (e.g., skin color, capillary refill, level of 
consciousness and general appearance), because these patients will not have a blood 
pressure and/or palpable pulse. 
 
11. The patient’s underlying rhythm only requires treatment if the patient has signs of poor 
perfusion. If external defibrillation or cardioversion is necessary, apply the pads as to 
avoid an internal Pacemaker/Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) and use the 
standard amount of energy. DO NOT disconnect the system controller from the 
percutaneous lead (driveline) or stop the pump prior to delivering the shock.

REVISED: 09-01-22 PAGE 310 OF 447
  
1200 Table of Contents 
 
12. For patients in cardiac arrest, assess for VAD malfunction in consultation with the device 
coordinator. Chest compressions should only be initiated if the VAD is functioning and 
the patient remains in cardiac arrest or if the VAD cannot be fixed and resuscitation is in 
agreement with the patient’s Advanced Health Care Directive or Standardized Patient-
Designated Directives (e.g., POLST, State DNR Form). 
 
13. In an unconscious, pulseless patient with a VAD, a capnography reading of < 20 is an 
indicator of poor systemic perfusion and should prompt initiation of chest compressions. 
 
Total Artificial Heart (TAH) 
14. Do not administer epinephrine. The resulting increase in afterload may cause pulmonary 
edema and circulatory collapse. 
 
15. For patients in respiratory distress with a systolic blood pressure >150mmHg, 
administration of nitroglycerin should be considered. Alternatively, the patient may be 
assisted in self-administration of their home dose of oral hydralazine.   
 
16. For patients in cardiac arrest, assess for TAH malfunction in consultation with the device 
coordinator. Do not perform chest compressions or attempt defibrillation. The only 
therapeutic option is to restore the function of the device.

i. The EMT will visually show the drug to the paramedic who will then confirm the 
name of the medication and the formulation verbally. 
ii. The paramedic will then use MCG 1309 to determine the route and dose based 
on color code which will be delivered in mLs to the patient. 
b. The paramedic not administering the medication will work together with the 
paramedic administering the medication (“patient man”) to identify the correct 
medication, route, and dose. 
i. The paramedic not administering the medication will visually show the 
medication to the patient man. The patient man will confirm the name of the 
medication and the formulation verbally. 
ii. The patient man will then use MCG 1309 to determine the route and dose based 
on the color code which will be verbally communicated back to the second 
paramedic prior to the delivery of the medication in mLs to the patient. 
3. If Base contact is made prior to administration, the paramedic will repeat the medication 
order including name of medication, number of mg or mcg, followed by mLs and color 
code, as applicable, to the base hospital. 
4. Base personnel who provide pro re nata (PRN) orders should have indications for 
administration as well as complete a full order including name of medication to be 
administered, mg or mcg, mLs, route, and color code as applicable. 
a. The paramedic administering the drug will repeat these back to the Base personnel 
as a secondary check and document the order. 
5. Base personnel, as applicable, and the paramedic should document all medications 
administered on the Base Hospital Form and EMS patient care record.  
6. All adverse events should be reported in the patient care record including interventions 
taken to treat the event (e.g., oxygen, suction, fluids). Any adverse events should be 
communicated to the receiving emergency department staff on transfer of care.

1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Patients in hemorrhagic shock may need to be transferred to a tertiary care or 
trauma center with blood/blood product transfusions in process as part of emergency 
resuscitation. 
 
2. Blood products include packed red blood cells (PRBCs), whole blood, fresh frozen 
plasma (FFP), platelets, cryoprecipitate, and prothrombin complex concentrates. 
 
3. The Los Angeles County EMS Agency does not authorize EMS personnel to start, 
hang or otherwise initiate the infusion of blood products unless they are participants in 
the Development and Rapid Operationalization of Prehospital Transfusion (LA-DROP) 
Pilot program. 
 
4. Destination of the patient for which paramedics transport while monitoring blood product 
transfusions is determined by current Los Angeles County EMS Agency destination 
policy (Ref. No. 502 Patient Destination). 
 
5. Transfusion reactions are defined as follows: 
a. Allergic reaction: hives or itching only, without signs of anaphylaxis. 
b. Anaphylaxis:  allergic reaction with angioedema, wheezing, respiratory distress, 
vascular instability, vomiting, diarrhea and/or shock. Rash may or may not be 
present. 
c. Hemolytic transfusion reaction:  life threatening reaction that may present with 
fever, headache, back pain, nausea, hypotension and pain at the infusion site. 
d. Volume overload: may develop pulmonary edema and respiratory distress. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Before accepting responsibility for the patient, confirm with a nurse or physician from 
the transferring facility, that the name on the patient's armband and blood bank number 
on the blood transfusion form is the same as the name  and  blood  bank  number  on the 
unit(s) of blood product which is (are) infusing. For  uncrossmatched  blood  products 
(which  will  not  have  a  patient  name),  confirm  the  uncrossmatched  blood  product 
transfusion  is  for  the  patient  being  transferred. A  patient  identification  band  must  be 
present prior to transfer. 
 
2. Document in the ePCR the physician order for the blood product(s) to be infused, which 
shall include the following:   
 
a. Type of blood product being infused 
b. Rate of the transfusion  
c. Name of the transferring/ordering physician 
 
3. Monitor all patients continuously during transport with a cardiac monitor and a 
noninvasive blood pressure monitor as per MCG 1308.

4. In patients with suspected transfusion reactions (including hemolytic reactions, allergic 
reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and volume overload): 
 
a. Stop the blood product transfusion  
b. Disconnect the IV tubing and flush the port  
c. Initiate care per applicable Treatment Protocol(s)  
d. Provide the remaining blood product and tubing to the receiving hospital 
 
5. Document volume of blood product transfused, any suspected transfusion reaction on 
the ePCR and communicate any reaction and interventions taken to receiving 
emergency department staff. 
 
6. All cases for which this MCG is implemented will be audited by the EMS provider 
agency and reports sent to the Los Angeles County EMS Agency as requested. 
 
7. The receiving emergency department staff will be responsible to communicate 
transfusion related adverse events to the transferring facility emergency department 
staff.

Medical Control Guideline: NEEDLE THORACOSTOMY 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Needle thoracostomy is an uncommon procedure that may provide life-saving treatment 
of a tension pneumothorax during prehospital care and transport. 
 
2. Risk of tension pneumothorax increases significantly after initiation of positive pressure 
ventilation (e.g., bag-mask ventilation, placement of advanced airway), which can 
convert a simple pneumothorax into a tension pneumothorax. 
 
3. Needle thoracostomy should be performed, if indicated as outlined in Guidelines 2.1 
below, prior to Base contact on any of the following patients: 
 
• PEA cardiac arrest with multisystem blunt trauma 
 
• Penetrating trauma which includes the thorax and abdomen or who have 
evidence of chest trauma with profound shock and signs of tension 
pneumothorax. 
 
4. PEA cardiac arrest maybe due to tension pneumothorax after positive pressure 
ventilation. 
 
5. ALS and Paramedic Assessment Units should carry an 8cm (3.0 – 3.5 inches) 14G 
commercial needle decompression device for the performance of emergency needle 
thoracostomy. 
 
6. The procedure for needle thoracostomy in pediatric patient is unchanged from that of 
adults. It is expected that a shorter distance will need to be traversed to enter the pleural 
space in children due to the thinner chest wall. 
 
7. Maintenance of skills requires regular in-service training on recognition and treatment of 
tension pneumothorax. It is strongly recommended that this training be completed in a 
simulation environment, rather than through slide-based or didactic learning.  
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Manage patient with traumatic injuries as per TP 1243/1243-P, Traumatic Arrest and/or 
TP 1244/1244-P, Traumatic Injury.  
2. Consider tension pneumothorax in the following patients.  
2.1. Trauma patients with obvious chest trauma (e.g., open chest wounds, evidence of 
crush or flail segment) or with mechanism consistent with chest trauma who 
demonstrate: 
 
a. Decreased or absent breath sounds on affected side, and  
b. SBP < 90mmHg (adult), hypotension relative to size per MCG 1309 (child 
and infant), and 
c. One or more of the following:   

SUBJECT:  NEEDLE THORACOSTOMY REFERENCE NO. 1335 
 
REVISED: 09-01-21 PAGE 316 OF 447
  
1200 Table of Contents 
i. Altered mental status  
ii. Severe respiratory distress, with RR > 30 breaths per minute or    
< 10 breaths per minute  
iii. Severe hypoxia, with < 90% oxygen saturation  
iv. Cool, pale, moist skin  
 
2.2 Traumatic full arrest with PEA rhythm (bilateral needle thoracostomy should be 
performed if evidence of chest wall trauma) 
 
2.3 Trauma patients requiring positive-pressure ventilation who develop hypoxia or 
severe hypotension (SBP < 90mmHg for adults, or relative to size for infants and 
children), without alternate cause, after initiation of positive pressure ventilation 
 
2.4 PEA cardiac arrest that develops after initiating positive pressure ventilation 
 
3. Immediately place all patients with suspected pneumothorax on high flow oxygen by 
non- rebreather mask. 
 
4. If the patient is awake and alert, explain medical condition and rationale for the 
procedure to the patient. 
 
5. Prepare skin of chest with alcohol or chlorhexidine prior to skin puncture. 
 
6. Insert the needle-catheter perpendicular to chest just above the 3
rd
 rib at the mid-
clavicular line (second intercostal space) or just above the 5
th
 or 6
th
 rib (fourth or fifth 
intercostal space) just anterior to the midaxillary line per training. Only place in sites for 
which paramedic has undergone specific training. 
 
7. Attach a syringe to the thoracostomy needle during procedure, if possible. Advance 
needle perpendicular to the chest wall while withdrawing on syringe until air is easily 
aspirated into the syringe (confirming penetration of lung pleura). Advance needle an 
additional 5 mm, then over the needle advance catheter further before withdrawing 
needle and disconnecting the syringe. For pediatric patients, insert no more than half the 
length of the needle or 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) as this is adequate in children under 15 years 
to enter the pleural space. 
 
8. Secure catheter to skin with tape or commercial device, if available. Do not place a one-
way valve on the catheter hub. 
 
9. If the patient has an open or sucking chest wound, cover the wound with a commercially 
available vented chest seal or vented (3-sided) occlusive dressing. Placement of a 
vented dressing can prevent conversion of an open pneumothorax to a tension 
pneumothorax. However, tension pneumothorax may still develop in the presence of a 
vented dressing and should be treated with needle thoracostomy. Furthermore, needle 
thoracostomy in a patient with evidence of tension pneumothorax should not be delayed 
for placement of dressing. 
 
10. If a patient does not improve after needle thoracostomy, or improves but later 
decompensates, and there is concern for catheter dislodgement or obstruction, needle 
thoracostomy may be repeated on the same side or at an alternate location.

Medical Control Guideline:  NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION BY EMS PROVIDERS 
(LEAVE BEHIND NALOXONE) 
1200 Table of Contents 
PURPOSE:  To authorize and describe procedures for EMS personnel to distribute naloxone 
kits to individuals at risk for experiencing or witnessing an opioid overdose. 
 
PRINCIPLES:  
 
1. Opioid overdose is one of the leading causes of death in the United States.  
 
2. Naloxone is a life-saving medication that reverses an opioid overdose by blocking the 
opioid receptor, reversing the toxic effects of the overdose, with minimal to no effect on 
an individual if opioids are not present in their system.  
 
3. Providing overdose prevention, recognition, and response education to drug users and 
their neighbors, friends, and families is a harm reduction intervention that saves lives.  
 
4. The Naloxone Distribution Project (NDP) is a federally funded “Leave Behind 
Naloxone” initiative administered by the Department of Health Care Services 
(DHCS) in California to combat opioid overdose-related deaths through the free 
distribution of naloxone to qualifying entities for the purpose of distribution to persons 
at risk for opiod overdose and those in a position to assist those persons at risk. 
EMS agencies in California are qualified entities to participate in this program. 
 
5. EMS personnel are encouraged to distribute naloxone to individuals at risk for opioid 
overdose, or any person in a position to assist individuals at risk, and train these 
individuals on appropriate naloxone use. 
 
GUIDELINES:  
 
1. EMS provider agencies may obtain naloxone kits, intended for layperson use, for 
distribution by EMS personnel to opioid overdose at risk individuals through the following 
mechanisms: 
 
a. NDP by completing and submitting an application to the DHCS to participate in

Medical Control Guideline:  ONLINE MEDICAL DIRECTION AND 
RECEIVING HOSPITAL NOTIFICATION 
1200 Table of Contents 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
 1. On-line Medical Direction is provided to prehospital provider(s) via voice communication 
from qualified Base hospital personnel (MICN or Base Physician) for the purposes of 
real-time patient care. 
 
 2. Receiving hospital notification is communication of patient information by prehospital 
provider(s) or Base hospital personnel for the purpose of preparing the receiving hospital 
staff for patient arrival. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
1. Online medical direction occurs when Base hospital contact is established by 
paramedics in order to obtain guidance on patient care from a designated paramedic 
Base hospital. 
2. In general, for situations requiring base hospital contact, the time when Base hospital 
contact is established will be based on paramedic judgement unless otherwise specified.  
3. The paramedic who provides direct patient care during transport shall have a means to 
establish communication with the Base hospital at all times. 
4. Once Base hospital contact is made for medical direction, the overall authority for 
patient’s medical care lies with the Base. The treatment plan based on Provider 
Impression should be developed collaboratively by prehospital providers and Base 
personnel. 
5. Treatments outlined in the applicable protocol may be administered by prehospital 
providers and communicated to the Base. 
6. Communication shall be maintained until the Base hospital ends the call. 
7. If Base hospital contact is made, the Base hospital is responsible for receiving hospital 
notification. 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Paramedics shall establish Base hospital contact for online medical direction on all 
patients who meet Base hospital contact criteria as specified in Ref. 1200.1, Treatment 
Protocol General Instructions and when directed by the Treatment Protocols. 
 
2. Utilize radios, the VMED28 radio frequency, or telephone to establish Base hospital 
contact. 
 
3. Paramedics shall clearly indicate the reason for the contact: 
 
a. “Base Contact for online medical direction.” 
b. “Providing notification of patient transport to your facility” or may simply state 
“Notification”

Medical Control Guideline:  PAIN MANAGEMENT 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. All patients should undergo pain assessment and management, regardless 
of age or ability to communicate in English. 
 
2. Uncontrolled pain has been associated with both short-term and long-term 
adverse outcomes. 
 
3. Measurement of a patient’s pain is subjective; therefore, the patient who is able 
to communicate best determines the presence and severity of their pain. 
 
4. Recording a pain level using a validated pain scale provides health care providers with 
a baseline against which to compare subsequent evaluations of the patient’s pain. 
 
5. Los Angeles County utilizes the “Numeric Pain Intensity”, “Facial Expression”, and 
FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability) pain scales. 
 
6. Pain management includes both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic 
interventions, such as distraction, positioning, and medication administration which 
may be provided concurrently or in an escalating fashion. 
 
7. When choosing a pain management strategy, providers should utilize their clinical 
judgement to select the most appropriate initial therapy. Treatment may be 
escalated as needed to achieve pain control. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Pain assessment   should be performed on patients of all ages as part of the initial 
patient assessment and should include severity as measured on one of the 3 formal 
pain scales used in Los Angeles County. 
 
2. For verbal patients 8 years of age or older, use the Numeric Pain Intensity scale 
by asking the patient to rate their pain on a 0-10 scale; zero (0) equals no pain 
and ten (10) equals the most severe pain. Document the number selected on the 
EMS Report Form. 
 
3. For patients 4-7 years old, or for patients with limited English proficiency, use the 
Facial Expression pain scale.

4. For children <4 years of age or for patients who are non-verbal due to baseline 
medical conditions such as cognitive impairment or severe dementia, utilize the 
FLACC Behavioral Tool. The patient should be assessed in each of the 5 categories 
shown in the table below, with the pain severity determined based on the total score on 
a scale of 0-10.

5. Reassess the patient’s pain with each assessment of vital signs and after any 
intervention, including patient movement into the ambulance. Document pain 
reassessment on the Patient Care Record. 
 
6. Provide indicated treatment to patients with mild to severe pain as measured on any 
0-10 scale per the table below. Nonpharmacologic methods should be used for all 
patients regardless of pain scale.

7. Consider ketorolac in patients with mild to moderate pain (pain score ≥ 4). Ketorolac 
may also be given in patients with moderate to severe pain (pain score ≥ 7) in 
conjunction with opioids, or when contraindications to opioids exist (e.g., hypotension, 
respiratory failure, opioid allergy). 
 
Ketorolac Dosing 
Adult Dose 
15mg (1mL) slow IV/IO push, or 
30mg (2mL) IM 
 
Pediatric Dose, only for 4 years of age or older 
0.5mg/kg (15mg/mL) slow IV/IO push/IM, dose per MCG 1309 
(maximum dose 15mg any route)

9. Specific treatment protocols may have pain medication dosing parameters that differ 
from this MCG. In such cases, treatment protocol dosing parameters take 
precedence.  
 
10. Use caution when administering paint medication in the following situations: 
 
a. Elderly patients 
b. Adults with SBB <90mmHg; Pediatrics with hypotension relative to size per MCG 
1309 (ketorolac preferred – this agent is less likely to worsen hypotension 
c. Potential for respiratory failure (ketorolac preferred – this is less likely to worsen 
respiratory depression) 
d. Suspected drug/alcohol intoxication 
 
11. When giving opioids, consider administering ondansetron 4mg ODT or IV prior to or 
concurrent with administration of the first dose in patients 4 years of age or older.

Medical Control Guideline:  PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 
1200 Table of Contents 
DEFINITION: 
 
Pediatric patients in the prehospital setting are defined as children 14 years of age and   
younger or, in the case that the is age unknown, the patient can be measured on the length-
based resuscitation tape (e.g., Broselow™). 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Pediatric patients require special consideration in assessment, treatment and 
medication administration. 
 
2. Pediatric assessment includes: pre-arrival preparation, scene size-up for hazards to 
patient or providers, assessment of scene for signs of child maltreatment, the 
Pediatric Assessment Triangle (PAT), vital signs, focused history using SAMPLE 
(signs and Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past Medical History, Last food or 
liquid intake, and Events leading to illness or injury), and a detailed physical exam as 
dictated by the patient’s presenting signs and symptoms and condition. 
 
3. PAT is composed of three components Appearance, Work of Breathing and 
Circulation to the Skin (Figure 1). 
 
a. The PAT is a “rapid Assessment Tool” that uses only visual and auditory clues 
and requires no equipment. 
 
b. The PAT is intended to allow the EMS provider to: 
i. Establish the child’s severity of illness 
ii. Determine sick or not sick 
iii. Recognize the general category of pathophysiology called the “general 
impression” 
iv. Determine the urgency of interventions 
 
c.   Appearance: Recalled by the mnemonic TICLS, an abnormality in any 
component is abnormal. 
i. Tone 
ii. Interactiveness 
iii. Consolability 
iv. Look/Gaze 
v. Speech/Cry 
 
d. Work of Breathing: Presence of any of the following implies abnormal work of 
breathing. 
i. Stridor 
ii. Wheezing 
iii. Grunting 
iv. Tripod positioning 
v. Retractions 
vi. Flaring 
vii. Apnea/Gasping  

SUBJECT:  PEDIATRIC PATIENTS REFERENCE NO. 1350 
 
REVISED: 10-01-23 PAGE 326 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
e. Circulation to the Skin: Presence of any of the following indicates abnormal 
circulation to the skin or signs of poor perfusion. 
i. Pale 
ii. Mottled 
iii. Cyanotic 
 
f.    Combining the PAT assessment based on these components can be used to 
determine the general impression (i.e., what, if anything, is critically wrong with 
the patient in terms of pathophysiology) which will dictate immediate 
management priorities (Figure 2): 
i. Stable 
ii. Respiratory distress 
iii. Respiratory failure 
iv. Shock 
v. CNS/Metabolic disorder 
vi. Cardiopulmonary failure/Cardiopulmonary Arrest 
 
4. Treatments, medication concentrations and drug dosages are age- or weight-specific 
for the pediatric patient. 
 
5. Accurate pediatric drug doses are obtained by: 
a. Measuring the patient against a pediatric length-based resuscitation tape 
(e.g., Broselow Tape) to obtain the weight/color zone, and then 
b. Referring to the MCG 1309 Color Code Drug Doses for the medication 
doses appropriate to that weight/color zone. 
 
6. Brief Resolved Unexplained Events (BRUE) is defined as a brief episode 
characterized by any of the following (for children 12 months of age or younger): 
 
a. Absent, decreased or irregular breathing 
b. Color change (usually cyanosis or pallor) 
c. Marked change in muscle tone (usually limpness or hypotonia, may also include 
hypertonia) 
d. Altered level of consciousness 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Assess using the PAT and initiate immediate treatment based on your 
general impression (Stable, Respiratory Distress, Respiratory 
Failure/Arrest, Shock, Center Nervous System Disorder/Metabolic 
Disorder, or Cardiopulmonary Failure/Arrest).  
 
2. Determine your Provider Impression and continue treatment per the corresponding 
Treatment Protocol. 
 
3. Document findings of the PAT, your assessment, and your Provider Impression. 
 
4. Obtain the patient’s estimated weight utilizing a pediatric length-based resuscitation tape 
and document the corresponding weight and color zone on the EMS Report Form.

5. Pediatric Airway Management: 
a. Bag Mask Ventilation (BMV) is the preferred method of airway management. 
b. Nasopharyngeal (NP) airway and oropharyngeal (OP) airway are approved 
airway adjuncts to facilitate BMV.  
c. i-gel is the approved supraglottic airway for pediatric patients in whom: BMV is 
difficult or ineffective; in respiratory arrest after BMV initiated; in cardiac arrest 
once resuscitation priorities have been met. Sizing per MCG 1309. 
d. Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) is approved for patients 12 years of age or 
greater, or longer than the length of the length-based resuscitation tape and 
should be utilized for these pediatric patients when there is a need for 
advanced airway and i-gel is contraindicated. 
 
6. Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): 
a. Use Neonatal CPR for newborns just after delivery in the first 24 hours of life 
b. Use Infant CPR for patients greater than 1 day of age to less than 13 
months of age 
c. Use Child CPR for patients greater than or equal to 13 months of age to the onset 
of puberty 
 
7. Automatic External Defibrillators (AED): 
Pediatric self-adhering pads or a pediatric attenuator system are recommended for 
infants and children younger than 8 years of age. When pediatric pads and/or a 
pediatric attenuator is not available, use adult AED and place front to back for 
infants and children

Medical Control Guideline: PERFUSION STATUS 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Perfusion status is determined by a combination of parameters that includes heart rate, 
blood pressure, tissue color and mentation.  No one parameter alone can be used to 
determine perfusion status. 
 
2. Adequate perfusion is defined as adequate circulation of blood through organs and 
tissues, manifested by normal pulse, tissue color, level of consciousness and blood 
pressure. 
 
3. Poor perfusion is defined as inadequate circulation of blood through organs and tissues 
manifested by vital sign abnormalities and/or signs and symptoms of organ dysfunction. 
 
4. Patients with poor perfusion that are unresponsive to initial fluid resuscitation are in 
shock. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. EMS providers should evaluate for the following signs and use clinical judgement to 
determine poor perfusion status: 
 
a. Bradycardia, tachycardia and/or poor pulse quality (weak/thready) 
 
b. Altered mental status (including anxiety, restlessness, lethargy, combative behavior) 
 
c. Adult systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90mmHg 
 
d. Delayed capillary refill time (>2 seconds) and/or changes in tissue color including 
pallor, cyanosis or mottling 
 
2. For pediatric patients, EMS providers should determine a patient to have poor perfusion 
if they exhibit altered mental status (including lethargy or agitation) with one or more of 
the following: 
 
a. Mottline, cyanosis, or flushed redness 
 
b. Bradycardia or tachycardia per MCG 1309 
 
c. Hypotension relative to size per MCG 1309 
 
d. Delayed capillary refill >2 seconds or flash capillary refill <1 second

Medical Control Guideline:  PROTECTION AGAINST POTENTIAL 
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES 
1200 Table of Contents 
PURPOSE: To describe processes for protection against communicable diseases including, 
personal protective equipment (PPE), isolation of the ambulance patient 
compartment, and decontamination of the ambulance post call. 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Airborne Transmission: Transmission of a communicable disease via residue from 
evaporated droplets or dust particles containing microorganisms which remain suspended in the 
air. 
 
Communicable Disease: A disease that is transmitted from human to human. 
 
Contact Transmission: Transmission of a communicable disease via direct contact of the 
infected person or via an object or material that can carry infectious particles. 
 
Donning: The process of applying PPE to oneself. 
 
Doffing: The process of removing PPE from oneself. 
 
Droplet Transmission: Transmission of a communicable disease via respiratory droplets that 
are too large to be airborne for long periods of time, and quickly settle out of air. 
 
Emerging Infectious Disease (EID): Infectious diseases that have newly appeared in a 
population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range, or that 
are caused by one of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category 
A, B, or C priority pathogens. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Exposure to communicable diseases in emergency medical response is a hazard that 
can be mitigated by proper use of PPE, implementation of strategies to isolate or 
increase airflow in the compartment, and decontamination of equipment after each 
patient encounter. 
 
2. Modes of transmission vary by microorganism. Transmission may occur via contact, 
respiratory droplets, and/or airborne particles. 
 
a. Standard (i.e., unknown transmission or no known communicable disease) 
b. Contact (i.e., infected areas of the person’s body such as skin infections, diarrhea) 
c. Droplet (i.e., COVID-19, influenza, meningitis, bronchiolitis, other respiratory viruses) 
d. Airborne (i.e., measles, varicella (chicken pox), disseminated herpes zoster, or 
tuberculosis) 
 
3. Standard precautions, formerly known as universal precautions, are the minimum PPE 
worn for every patient encounter. 
 
 
4. The appropriate strategies, including the use of PPE beyond standard precautions, are 
selected by anticipating which communicable disease may be present on scene and the 
route by which that communicable disease is transmitted. 
 

SUBJECT: PROTECTION AGAINST POTENTIAL REFERENCE NO. 1357 
        COMMUNICABLE DISEASE                                                         
 
 
REVISED: 10-01-23 PAGE 331 OF 447 
5. During periods of respiratory illness or emerging infectious disease surge, it is prudent to 
apply the highest level of PPE and mitigation strategies until additional information is 
known about the transmission route and communicability of the disease. 
 
6. Donning appropriate PPE is an essential part of provider safety and takes precedence 
over expediting patient care.  
 
7. Donning and doffing should be performed in the presence of a partner to ensure proper 
technique. 
 
GUIDELINES:  
 
1. Perform hand hygiene prior to donning PPE. 
 
2. Don PPE in the following sequence from first on to last on: gown, mask or respirator, eye 
protection, gloves. If two-glove technique used don first pair of gloves first and second 
pair of gloves last. 
 
3. Don the appropriate PPE and take the following precautions during care of a patient with 
a confirmed or suspected communicable disease, see Table 1.  
 
4. For all precautions, limit the number of providers in the patient compartment to only 
essential personnel to minimize exposures. 
 
5. Maintain PPE throughout the patient encounter. Doff PPE once the patient encounter is 
complete. 
 
6. Doff PPE in the following sequence from first off to last off: gown, gloves, goggles or 
face shield, mask or respirator. If two-glove technique used doff first pair of gloves first 
and second pair of gloves last. 
 
a. Contaminated surfaces of the PPE are the outer glove surface, front portion of 
the gown/raincoat, front portion of the eye protection, and front portion of the 
mask and any other surfaces that knowingly came into contact with the patient or 
were otherwise contaminated. Clean surfaces of the PPE include the rear portion 
of the gown/raincoat, eye protection straps, and mask straps. 
 
b. PPE should be doffed by clean hands coming into contact with clean portions of 
the PPE only. 
 
7. Dispose of doffed PPE in a biohazard container. 
 
8. Perform proper hand hygiene. 
 
9. Refer to the CDC for on additional guidance on donning and doffing PPE: 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/using-ppe.html 
 
10. After each patient encounter decontaminate all surfaces of durable medical equipment 
using Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved disinfectant and dispose of all 
disposable medical equipment that came in contact with the patient or the scene per 
provider agencies protocols. If a raincoat is used as a gown, wipe down with EPA 
approved disinfectant and hang up to air dry.

Medical Control Guideline:  SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION (SMR) 
1200 Table of Contents 
DEFINITION: 
 
Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR) describes the procedure used to care for patients with 
possible unstable spinal injuries.  SMR includes: Reduction of gross movement by the 
patient; prevention of additional damage to the spine; and regular reassessment of 
motor/sensory function. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. SMR involves maintaining a neutral in-line position of the spine at all times during patient 
treatment and transport.  SMR requires the patient’s head, neck and torso to be 
appropriately stabilized.  This can be achieved manually or with the use of commercially 
available equipment. 
 
2. There are multiple commercial devices that may be used to assist with SMR during 
patient movement.  In addition, there are harmful side effects of these devices that must 
be considered. 
 
3. Prehospital provider assessment will determine if SMR is required.  
 
4. Prehospital providers should use judgment and consider SMR for patients without 
neurologic findings, but in whom one is still concerned for unstable spinal injury.  
  
5. A cervical collar alone does not provide adequate SMR.  To provide appropriate SMR, 
the patient must be maintained in a neutral in-line position during movement and while 
on the gurney. Patients with potential thoracolumbar injury should be supine or reverse 
Trendelenburg. 
 
6. The backboard is an extrication device.  It may also be used to provide splinting during 
movement of patients with multiple traumatic injuries.  While a backboard may be used 
to assist with SMR during the extrication phase, it is not required for SMR.  
 
7. Once the patient is on the ambulance gurney, the backboard does not provide any 
advantage and may cause harm related to increased pain, increased lateral movement, 
and increased imaging at the hospital. 
 
8. The backboard should not be maintained during transport for the purposes of SMR. 
Whenever possible, patients should be rolled off the backboard prior to transport.  
Exceptions are patients who are hemodynamically unstable or when there are scene 
safety concerns. 
 
9. A backboard should not be used in the ambulatory patient (i.e. a patient who is standing 
and/or walking at the time of EMS arrival).   
 
10. SMR is generally not indicated for penetrating injuries and transport must not be delayed 
to maintain SMR.  Treatment of patients with penetrating trauma should not involve a 
backboard unless it is required as an extrication device.   
 
11. Safe and proper removal of the helmet should be done by two people following steps 
outlined in an approved trauma curriculum. 

SUBJECT:  SPINAL MOTION RESTRICTION (SMR) REFERENCE NO. 1360 
 
REVISED: 12-01-18 PAGE 334 OF 447 
1200 Table of Contents 
12. Paramedic assessment, in accordance with guidelines below, will determine whether 
SMR is required. Whenever BLS has initiated SMR, paramedics should strongly 
consider maintaining c-collar and spinal precautions until hospital evaluation. Once SMR 
has been determined necessary based upon paramedic assessment, it should be 
maintained throughout the prehospital phase of care by whatever methods the provider 
deems appropriate. This does not include continuation of the backboard, which, if used 
to assist during extrication, should be removed once patient is on gurney. 
 
13. The method by which SMR is maintained and devices used may be adjusted to meet the 
needs of the patient.  In particular, management of the patient’s airway may necessitate 
alternate SMR methods and should take precedence. 
 
14. For purposes of the assessment, an unreliable patient is anyone who is altered, 
intoxicated or nonverbal.  Limited evaluation may be due to communication barrier, 
uncooperative patient or patient too distracted by other injuries and circumstances.  An 
abnormal spine exam is any deformity or tenderness along the spine. 
 
15. For the purposes of the pediatric assessment, an abnormal torso exam refers to 
evidence of substantial torso injury, defined as injuries thought to be potentially life 
threatening to the thorax including the chest wall, abdomen, flanks, back and pelvis with 
an unstable chest wall, abdominal distension or significant  chest or abdominal 
tenderness. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Every patient with trauma, including ambulatory patients, must receive an assessment.  
If any assessment component is positive, the patient requires SMR.                           
(See age-appropriate SMR algorithm.) 
 
2. Patients initially placed in SMR by BLS providers whose care is transferred to ALS 
providers, shall receive a paramedic assessment to determine if continuation of SMR is 
indicated. 
 
3. Neurological examination includes:  
a. Test of sensation and abnormal sensation (parasthesias) in all 4 extremities   
b. Test of motor skills in all 4 extremities with active movements by the patient        
(avoid just reflexive movements like hand grasp) to include:  wrist/finger extension 
and flexion, foot plantar and dorsiflexion   
c. Frequent reassessment. 
 
4. All history and examinations pertinent to the decision for spinal motion restriction, as 
outlined in the adult and pediatric algorithms, must be assessed and documented on the 
ePCR. 
 
5. Padding may be necessary to maintain neutral alignment particularly in children <3 years 
old who have a large occiput forcing the head forward when supine. 
 
6. Infants in rear facing car seats may be immobilized and extricated in the car seat as long 
as the patient is stable and does not exhibit signs of respiratory distress or shock. 
 
7. Children restrained in a car seat with a high back should be extricated in the car seat 
and then be placed in SMR as appropriate.  Children in booster seats (without a back) 
should be placed in SMR as appropriate.

Medical Control Guideline:  TRANSCUTANEOUS PACING 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Transcutaneous Pacing (TCP) provides temporary external cardiac pacing for the 
treatment of symptomatic bradycardia for patients who are unresponsive to airway 
management or drug therapy. 
 
2. TCP should not be initiated on patients in asystole. 
 
3. Do not delay TCP for IV access if the patient has poor perfusion. 
   
4. Strongly consider sedation for pacing discomfort.  Refer to TP 1212 or 1212-P, Cardiac 
Dysrhythmia - Bradycardia for drugs and dosages. 
 
5. All TCP equipment must be used and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s 
guidelines. 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Explain the procedure to the patient, family member, and/or caregiver. 
 
2. For awake patients, provide sedation and analgesia unless contraindicated.  
Contraindications include RR < 10 for adults (for pediatrics < lower limit for color code on 
MCG 1309) or unresponsiveness. 
 
3. Place pacing pads in anterior (black)/posterior (red) (A/P) position and connect ECG 
cable. 
 
4. Activate the pacing device, set the initial pacing rate at 70 bpm or 100 bpm for children 
less than 12 months of age.   
 
5. Set the current at 40 milliamperes (mAs).  Slowly increase the mA until electrical and 
mechanical capture is achieved as evidenced by a palpable pulse that correlates with 
the paced heart rate on the monitor.  Once capture is noted increase the mAs by 10mAs 
to ensure ongoing capture. 
 
6. If current is increased to 120-130 mAs without capture; reposition the pacer pads on the 
upper right chest and at the apex of the heart and reattempt pacing and capturing as 
above. 
 
7. If the patient continues to exhibit signs and symptoms of poor perfusion, increase the 
rate by 10 bpm until adequate perfusion is achieved.  Maximum rate is 100 bpm for 
adults and 120 bpm for children.

Medical Control Guideline: TRAUMATIC HEMORRHAGE CONTROL  
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Applying direct continuous pressure to the area of bleeding should be the first 
management technique to control external bleeding. 
 
2. Tourniquets have been demonstrated to be safe and effective when used appropriately 
and can be lifesaving. 
 
3. A hemorrhage control tourniquet should be used if external bleeding from an extremity 
cannot be controlled by direct pressure to an exposed wound. 
 
4. Poorly perfusing patients with an isolated penetrating extremity injury and those with 
amputations or mangled extremities should have a tourniquet applied even if minimal to 
no visible bleeding. 
 
5. Tourniquet application may be the initial method to control extremity bleeding when 
scene safety concerns, resource limitations, or patient position/entrapment preclude 
direct pressure application. 
 
6. Tourniquet application frequently results in severe pain. Pain management should be 
provided as necessary.  
 
7. Hemostatic Agents are only to be utilized by approved providers.  
 
8. Tranexamic acid (TXA) acts to prevent clot breakdown and improves outcomes for 
trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock if administered within 3 hours of injury, with 
increasing benefit the sooner it is administered. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. First, remove any bandages applied by patient or bystanders, identify the area of 
bleeding, and apply continuous, firm, focused pressure directly to source of bleeding 
using gauze or hemostatic agents as appropriate. 
 
2. If unable to control hemorrhage with direct pressure, or if scene or patient safety 
precludes application of direct pressure, prepare for tourniquet application. 
 
3. Explain usage of tourniquet to the patient if patient’s condition allows. 
 
4. Follow manufacturer’s instructions for application of the tourniquet. 
 
5. Apply tourniquet 2-3 inches proximal to the bleeding site but not over a joint or the 
hemorrhaging injury. 
 
6. Ensure that bleeding is stopped and distal pulses are absent after the application of the 
tourniquet. 
 
7. Once a tourniquet is applied, the patient should be reassessed at least every 5 minutes 
for continued absence of distal pulse and/or bleeding.

REVISED: 07-01-25 PAGE 339 OF 447
  
1200 Table of Contents 
 
8. If bleeding is not controlled with one tourniquet, a second tourniquet may be applied 
proximal to the first tourniquet.  Do not remove the first tourniquet after applying the 
second tourniquet. 
 
9. Once a tourniquet is applied it should not be loosened or removed without physician 
approval. 
 
10. Provide analgesia per MCG 1345 and refer to TP 1244 or 1244-P, Traumatic Injury and 
TP 1242 or 1242-P, Crush Injury/Syndrome as appropriate for dosing. 
 
11. For adult patients within 3 hours of injury and uncontrolled external/extremity bleeding 
despite applying pressure, and use of hemostatic agents and tourniquets where 
appropriate, administer TXA per MCG 1317.41.  
 
12. For adult patients within 3 hours of injury with suspected uncompressible truncal 
hemorrhage and systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90mmHg OR heart rate>SBP, 
administer TXA per MCG 1317.41.   
 
13. Paramedics shall make Base hospital contact and transport in accordance with           
Ref. 1200.1 and Ref. 502, Patient Destination. In general, patients requiring tourniquets 
should be transported to a Trauma Center. 
 
14. Paramedic shall document the time tourniquet applied on the tourniquet and on the EMS 
Report Form. Remaining patient documentation will be in accordance with Ref. 606, 
Documentation of Prehospital Care.

Medical Control Guideline: VASCULAR ACCESS 
1200 Table of Contents 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Vascular access is a catheter inserted intravenously (IV) or a needle inserted 
intraosseously (IO), through which medications and/or fluids can be administered. 
 
2. Not all patients will require vascular access.  
 
3. Peripheral IV, placed by EMS, is the preferred vascular access method for patients 
requiring parenteral therapy.  
 
4. Intraosseous (IO) placement or use of a pre-existing vascular access device (PVAD) 
may be necessary for patients requiring emergent prehospital vascular access in whom 
an IV cannot be readily placed. 
 
GUIDELINES:  
 
 Intravenous Lines 
1. Paramedics should first attempt placement of an IV saline lock for patients requiring 
parenteral access for medications or fluid volume.  
 
2. In patients whose clinical condition allows, a minimum of two attempts at IV insertion 
should be made prior to consideration of IO placement. 
 
 Intraosseous Lines 
 
3. IO access is indicated for adult and pediatric patients in cardiopulmonary arrest, 
shock/poor perfusion, severe burns, crush syndrome, and extremis when intravenous 
(IV) access is not possible or cannot be achieved quickly. 
 
a. IO contraindications: 
• Deformity, suspected fracture, or infection at the placement site 
• Inability to identify landmarks 
 
b. The most common complication of IO placement is local infiltration of fluid resulting 
in tissue damage or compartment syndrome. Other, rare complications include 
growth plate injury in pediatric patients, skin or bone infection, and fat embolism into 
the patient’s circulation. 
 
c. If the patient requires vascular access for medication/fluid administration, but does 
not meet the indications above, CONTACT BASE to discuss IO placement. 
 
d. If an IO is in place, IV medications may be given by IO route even if not specifically 
stated in the Treatment Protocol.  
 
4. IO Placement is approved for all Provider Agencies for placement at the flat surface of 
the proximal medial tibia, utilizing the tibial tuberosity (pediatric and adult patients) as the 
landmark for proper placement. It may also be placed in the greater tuberosity of the

humeral head (adults only - with prior Provider Agency approval by the EMS Agency).  
The preferred IO site should be free from signs of infection or trauma. 
 
a. Explain the plan to use the IO as a vascular access site to the patient, family or 
caregiver if present during the resuscitation. 
 
b. lO placement may be attempted once on each tibia and/or each proximal humerus. 
Note that the proximal humerus site may be more effective for delivering 
resuscitation medications. However, humeral IO placement should not be attempted 
unless the paramedic has been trained in use of this location. 
 
c. Prior to using the IO line slowly flush with 10mL normal saline.  The IO site can be 
used if it flushes easily without signs of swelling in the soft tissues around or behind 
the bone.  
 
d. Document all sites where IO access is attempted and/or achieved. 
 
e. If swelling occurs or infiltration is suspected, stop infusion, remove IO needle, and 
apply pressure bandage to the IO site. 
 
5. Pain management: If utilizing IO for conditions other than cardiopulmonary arrest, 
lidocaine should be instilled to decrease pain associated with medication/fluid 
administration, prior to administration of any other medications/fluids. Infuse lidocaine 
2% at the dosage listed below.  Slow infusion is necessary to ensure the lidocaine 
remains in the medullary space of the bone. Allow lidocaine to dwell in space for 60 
seconds prior to flushing with normal saline. If patient experiences pain on medication or 
NS flush after initial dose of lidocaine, repeat with half of the initial dose.  
 
• Adults: Lidocaine 2% 40mg slow IO push  
• Pediatric: Lidocaine 2% (20 mg/ml) 0.5mg/kg slow IO push, dose per         
MCG 1309. Not to exceed the adult dose. 
 Pre-existing Vascular Access Devices (PVAD)  
 
6. Pre-existing vascular access devices (PVAD) (e.g. PICC lines, ports) provide access to 
the central circulation through a long catheter inserted beneath the skin, allowing rapid, 
pain-free administration of medications and intravenous fluid. 
 
• Patients and caregivers can often provide valuable information regarding PVAD. 
 
7. EMS personnel should consider other routes of medication administration such as 
intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) before using pre-existing vascular access devices in 
patients without cardiopulmonary arrest. 
 
8. EMS personnel may utilize the following PVADs with externally visible access ports 
without base order for patients in cardiopulmonary arrest or shock requiring immediate 
treatment, if unable to place IV or IO successfully at other sites.   
 
a. Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters (PICC lines) – Figure 1 
• Swab ports with alcohol swabs twice, utilizing two separate alcohol swabs 
• Withdraw 5-10 mL of blood into a syringe to clear any small clots that may have 
formed before infusing medications/fluids

b. Tunneling catheters such as Broviac, Hickman, and Groshong – Figure 2 
 
c. Non-tunneled, dual lumen catheters used for temporary dialysis access, i.e., Quinton 
catheters 
 
9. Base hospital order is required to use any PVADs for patients not in cardiopulmonary 
arrest or shock.   
 
10. Devices that require puncture of the skin (those without visible external access 
ports) may be accessed ONLY IN CARDIAC ARREST AND WITH BASE ORDER. 
 
a. Arteriovenous shunts (synthetic bridges between the arterial and venous circulation 
used for dialysis; located under the skin of the forearm) – Figures 3 and 4 
 
b. Subcutaneous internal access devices that require access through the skin (often 
 found in the upper chest or forearm) for example, Port-a-Cath – Figure 5 
 
11. Observe adherence to sterile technique when handling PVADs. Contamination of these 
devices may cause severe infection or dysfunction requiring surgical removal.  
 
12. Do not introduce air or allow IV fluids to run dry; these are direct lines into the central 
circulation. 
 
13. Use padded hemostats to clamp the catheter if catheter gets damaged during access.

PURPOSE: To ensure that 9-1-1 patients are transported to the most appropriate facility that 
is staffed, equipped, and prepared to administer emergency and/or definitive care 
appropriate to the needs of the patient. 
 
AUTHORITY: Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.220 
California Administrative Code, Title 13, Section 1105 (c) 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. In the absence of decisive factors to the contrary, 9-1-1 patients shall be transported to 
the most accessible 9-1-1 receiving facility equipped, staffed, and prepared to receive 
emergency cases and administer emergency care appropriate to the needs of the 
patient. 
 
2. The most accessible receiving (MAR) facility may or may not be the closest facility 
geographically. Transport personnel shall take into consideration traffic, weather 
conditions, or other factors that may influence transport time in identifying the most 
accessible facility. 
 
3. The most appropriate receiving facility for a patient may be the health facility which is 
affiliated with their health plan. Depending upon the patient’s chief complaint and 
medical history, it may be in the patient’s best interest to be transported to their ‘medical 
home’, as defined by their health plan, personal physician, and/or medical records. 
 
4. Patients shall not be transported to a medical facility that is on diversion due to internal 
disaster. 
 
5. Notwithstanding any other provision of this reference, and in accordance with Ref. No. 
503, Guidelines for Hospitals Requesting Diversion of ALS Patients, final authority for 
patient destination rests with the base hospital handling the call. Base hospitals shall 
honor diversion requests based on patient condition and available system resources.    
9-1-1 patients shall ordinarily be transported to general acute care hospitals with a basic 
emergency department permit. Transport to other medical facilities (hospitals with a 
stand-by permit, clinics and other medical facilities approved by the EMS Agency) shall 
be performed only in accordance with this policy. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Transport of Patients by EMT Personnel 
 
A. EMT personnel shall transport 9-1-1 patients deemed stable and requiring only 

SUBJECT: PATIENT DESTINATION REFERENCE NO. 502 
 
 
 
 
 
 PAGE 364 OF 447 
 
  
 
 basic life support (BLS) to the MAR (exception: BLS Diversion or Internal 
Disaster).   
 
B. If the MAR has requested BLS diversion as per Ref. 503, the patient may be 
diverted to an alternate facility assuming the involved BLS unit estimates that it 
can reach an alternate facility within fifteen (15) minutes from the incident 
location.  If there are no open facilities within this time frame, BLS patients shall 
be directed to the MAR, regardless of its diversion status (exception: Internal 
Disaster). 
 
C. EMT personnel may honor patient requests to be transported to other than the 
MAR provided that the patient is deemed stable, requires basic life support 
measures only, and the ambulance is not unreasonably removed from its primary 
area of response. In order to facilitate this, EMT personnel may transfer care of a 
patient to another EMT team if necessary. 
 
D. In life-threatening situations (e.g., unmanageable airway or uncontrollable 
hemorrhage) in which the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of the paramedics 
exceeds the ETA to the MAR, EMTs should exercise their clinical judgment as to 
whether it is in the patient’s best interest to be transported prior to the arrival of 
paramedics. 
 
E. EMT personnel may immediately transport hypotensive trauma patients with life-
threatening, penetrating injuries to the torso to the closest trauma center, not the 
MAR, when the transport time is less than the estimated time of paramedic 
arrival.  The transporting unit should make every effort to contact the receiving 
trauma center while in route. 
 
II. Transport of Patients by Paramedic Personnel 
 
A. Patients should be transported to the MAR unless: 
 
1. The base hospital determines that another facility is more appropriate to 
meet the needs of the patient; or 
 
2. The patient meets criteria or guidelines for transport to a specialty care 
center (i.e., Trauma Center, Pediatric Trauma Center, ST-Elevation 
Myocardial Infarction Receiving Center, Emergency Department 
Approved for Pediatrics, Pediatric Medical Center, Perinatal Center, 
Sexual Assault Response Team Center, or Designated Stroke Center); 
 
3. The patient requests a specific hospital; and 
 
a. The patient’s condition is considered sufficiently stable to tolerate 
additional transport time; and 
 
b. The requested hospital does not have a defined service area (see 
Section V of this policy); and 

SUBJECT: PATIENT DESTINATION REFERENCE NO. 502 
 
 
 
 
 
 PAGE 365 OF 447 
 
  
 
 
c. The requested hospital can provide services appropriate to the 
patient’s chief complaint; and 
 
d. The EMS provider has determined that such a transport would not 
unreasonably remove the unit from its primary area of response.  
If the provider is unable to honor the request, and the patient 
therefore refuses to be transported, the provider should attempt to 
arrange for alternate transportation (i.e., private ambulance), in 
order to assist patient with receiving necessary treatment. 
 
4. The MAR has requested diversion of 9-1-1 patients requiring advanced 
life support (ALS) as specified in Ref. No. 503. ALS patients may be 
directed to an alternate open facility provided: 
 
a. The patient does not exhibit an unmanageable airway or 
uncontrolled hemorrhage. 
 
b. The involved ALS unit estimates that it can reach an alternate 
facility within fifteen (15) minutes, Code 3, from the incident 
location.  If there are no open facilities within this time frame, ALS 
patients shall be directed to the MAR, regardless of its diversion 
status (exception: Internal Disaster). 
 
B. Paramedic personnel may transfer care of a patient to another paramedic team if 
necessary.  If base hospital contact has been made, the initial paramedic team 
shall advise the base hospital that another paramedic team has assumed 
responsibility for the patient. 
 
lll. Destination of Restrained Patients 
 
A. Restrained patients shall be transported to the MAR within the guidelines of this 
policy.  Allowable exceptions: 
 
 1. Patients without a medical complaint, with a 5150 order written by a 
designated Department of Mental Health Team, when transport to a 
psychiatric facility has been arranged. 
 
 2. A law enforcement request for transport to medical facilities other than the 
closest may be honored with base hospital concurrence. 
 
IV. Transport to Hospitals or Medical Facilities that are Non 9-1-1 Receiving Facilities 
 
A. Patient requests for transport to hospitals that are not 9-1-1 Receiving Facilities 
may be honored by EMT or paramedic personnel provided: 
 
1. The patient, family, or private physician is made aware that the requested 
hospital is not a 9-1-1 receiving facility; 

SUBJECT: PATIENT DESTINATION REFERENCE NO. 502 
 
 
 
 
 
 PAGE 366 OF 447 
 
  
 
 
2. The Base hospital or EMS provider contacts the requested facility and 
ensures that the hospital has agreed to accept the patient; 
 
3. If transport requires additional transport time, the patient’s condition is 
considered sufficiently stable to tolerate and the EMS provider has 
determined that such a transport would not unreasonably remove the unit 
from its primary area of response 
 
B. Other medical facilities approved on an individual basis by the EMS Agency: 
 
9-1-1 patients may be transported to medical facilities other than hospitals 
(i.e., clinics, etc.) only when approved in advance by the EMS Agency. 
 
V. Transport to Designated Service Area Facilities 
 
A. Patients shall be transported by EMT or paramedic personnel to hospitals with a 
designated service area whenever the incident location is within the hospital’s 
defined service area (exception: diversion for Internal Disaster).  In most 
instances, the service area hospital is also the MAR. 
 
B. If a patient within the defined service area meets criteria or guidelines for a 
specialty care center, for care not provided by the service area hospital, this 
patient shall be transported to the appropriate specialty care center. 
 
C. Patient requests for transport to a service area hospital when the incident 
location is outside the hospital’s defined service area or inside the service area of 
another hospital, may be honored by:  
 
1. EMT personnel if it is a BLS patient, the receiving hospital is contacted 
and agrees to accept the patient, and the transporting unit is not 
unreasonably removed from its primary response area. 
 
2. Paramedic personnel if the base hospital is contacted and concurs that 
the patient’s condition is sufficiently stable to permit the estimated 
transport time, the requested hospital agrees to accept the patient, and 
the transporting unit is not unreasonably removed from its primary 
response area.  The receiving hospital may be contacted directly if the 
ALS unit is transporting a BLS patient.

PURPOSE: To establish criteria and standards which ensure that patients requiring the care 
of a trauma center are appropriately triaged and transported. 
 
AUTHORITY: California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Section 1105(c) California Code of 
Regulations, Title 22, Section 100236 et seq. Health and Safety Code, Div. 2.5, 
Section 1797 et seq., and 1317. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Trauma patients should be secured and transported from the scene as quickly as 
possible, consistent with optimal trauma care. 
 
2. Paramedics shall make base hospital contact to the receiving trauma center on all 
injured patients who meet trauma triage criteria and/or guidelines.  Notification to the 
receiving trauma center shall be made whenever paramedic judgment determines 
transport to the trauma center is in the patient’s best interest. Contact shall be 
accomplished in such a way as not to delay transport. 
 
3. Do not delay transport of hypotensive patients with penetrating torso trauma in order to 
apply spinal motion restriction. 
 
4. EMT personnel may immediately transport hypotensive patients with life-threatening, 
penetrating injuries to the torso to the closest trauma center, not the Most Accessible 
Receiving (MAR), when the transport time is less than the estimated time of paramedic 
arrival. The transporting unit should make every effort to contact the receiving trauma 
center. 
 
5. When pediatric and adult trauma patients are transported together in one aircraft, the 
receiving trauma center shall be both a trauma center and a pediatric trauma center. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Trauma Criteria – Requires immediate transportation to a designated trauma center 
 
Patients who fall into one or more of the following categories are to be transported directly to 
the designated trauma center, if transport time does not exceed 30 minutes. 
 
A. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, or less than 70 mmHg in infants age 
less than one year 
 

 
SUBJECT: TRAUMA TRIAGE     REFERENCE NO. 506

breaths/minute, less than 20 breaths/minute in infants age less than one year, or 
requiring ventilatory support 
 
C. Cardiopulmonary arrest with penetrating torso trauma unless based upon the 
paramedic’s thorough assessment is found apneic, pulseless, asystolic, and 
without pupillary reflexes upon arrival of EMS personnel at the scene 
 
D. All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso, and extremities proximal to the elbow 
or knee 
 
E. Blunt head injury associated with a suspected skull fracture, altered level of 
consciousness (Glasgow Coma Score less than or equal to 14), seizures, 
unequal pupils, or focal neurological deficit

extremity 
 
2. Amputation proximal to the wrist or ankle 
 
3. Fractures of two or more proximal (humerus/femur) long-bones 
 
4. Bleeding not controlled by direct pressure requiring the usage of a 
hemorrhage control tourniquet or hemostatic agent (approved provider 
agencies only)  
 
K. Fall from height > 10 feet (all patients) 
 
L. Passenger space intrusion of greater than 12 inches into an occupied passenger 
space 
 
M. Ejected from vehicles (partial or complete)

(greater than 20 mph) impact 

 
SUBJECT: TRAUMA TRIAGE     REFERENCE NO. 506 
 
 PAGE 370 OF 447 
 
 
O. Unenclosed transport crash with significant (greater than 20 mph) impact 
 
P. Major / Critical Burn (excluding those in which the MAR is a recognized Burn 
Center, e.g., Los Angeles General Medical Center, Torrance Memorial Medical 
Center, West Hills Hospital): 
 
1. Patients 15 years of age or older with 2
nd
 (partial thickness) and 3
rd
 (full 
thickness) degree burns involving equal to or greater than 20% Total Body 
Surface Area (TBSA) 
 
2. Patients ≤ 14 years of age with 2
nd
 (partial thickness) and 3
rd
 (full thickness) 
degree burns involving equal to or greater than 10% TBSA 
 
II. Trauma Guidelines – Mechanism of injury and patient history are the most effective 
methods of selecting critically injured patients before unstable vital signs develop. 
Paramedics and base hospital personnel should consider mechanism of injury and 
patient history when determining patient destination. At the discretion of the base 
hospital, transportation to a trauma center is advisable for: 
 
A. Passenger space intrusion of greater than 18 inches into any unoccupied 
passenger space 
 
B. Automobile versus pedestrian/bicyclist/motorcyclist (impact equal to or less than 
20 mph) 
 
C. Injured victims of vehicular crashes in which a fatality occurred in the same 
vehicle 
 
D. Patients requiring extrication 
 
E. Vehicle telemetry data consistent with high risk of injury 
 
F. Injured patients (excluding isolated minor extremity injuries): 
 
1. on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, other than aspirin-only 
 
2. with bleeding disorders 
 
III. Special Considerations – Consider transporting injured patients with the following to a 
trauma center: 
 
A. Patients in blunt traumatic full arrest who, based on a paramedic’s thorough 
patient assessment, was not found apneic, pulseless, and without organized ECG 
activity (narrow complex supraventricular rhythm) upon the arrival of EMS 
personnel at the scene 

 
SUBJECT: TRAUMA TRIAGE     REFERENCE NO. 506 
 
 PAGE 371 OF 447 
 
 
B. Systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg may represent shock after age 65 
years 
 
C. Heart rate greater than systolic blood pressure for ≥ 14 years of age 
 
D. Child (0-9 years of age) unrestrained or in an unsecured child safety seat 
 
E. Pregnancy greater than 20 weeks gestation 
 
F. Prehospital judgment 
 
IV. Extremis Patients - Requires immediate transportation to the MAR: 
 
A. Patients with an obstructed airway or those with concern for imminent airway 
obstruction due to inhalation injury 
 
B. Patients, as determined by the base hospital personnel, whose lives would be 
jeopardized by transportation to any destination but the MAR 
 
V. When, for whatever reason, base hospital contact cannot be made, the destination 
decision for injured patients will be made by paramedics using the principles set forth 
above. 
 
VI. 9-1-1 Trauma Re-Triage – This section applies to injured patients in emergency 
departments of non-trauma centers whose injuries were initially estimated by EMS to be 
less serious (under triaged) or patients who self-transported (walk-in) to a non-trauma 
center, and subsequently assessed by the non-trauma center physician to require 
immediate trauma center care. The referring facility shall utilize the procedure outlined 
below to expedite transfer arrangements and rapid transport to the trauma center. This 
process should be reserved for patients with life-threatening traumatic injuries requiring 
emergent surgical intervention. 
 
A. Determine if the injured patient meets any of the following 9-1-1 Trauma Re-
Triage criteria: 
 
1. Persistent signs of poor perfusion 
 
2. Need for immediate blood replacement therapy 
 
3. Intubation required 
 
4. Glasgow Coma Score less than 9 
 

 
SUBJECT: TRAUMA TRIAGE     REFERENCE NO. 506 
 
 PAGE 372 OF 447 
 
5. Glasgow Coma Score deteriorating by 2 or more points during 
observation 
 
6. Penetrating injuries to head, neck and torso 
 
7. Extremity injury with neurovascular compromise or loss of pulses 
 
8. Patients, who in the judgement of the evaluating emergency physician, 
have high likelihood of requiring emergent life- or limb-saving intervention 
within two (2) hours. 
 
B. Contact the designated receiving trauma center or pediatric trauma center if the 
patient is less than or equal to 14 years of age and transport does not exceed 30 
min. Do not delay transfer by initiating any diagnostic procedures that do not 
have direct impact on immediate resuscitative measures. 
 
C. Contact 9-1-1 for transportation. The paramedic scope of practice (Ref. No. 803) 
does not include paralyzing agents. Paramedics can monitor infusion of blood 
products that have been started by the transferring hospital prior to transport. 
 
D. Prepare patient and available medical records for immediate transport. Do not 
delay transport for medical records which could be sent at a later time.

PURPOSE: To ensure that 9-1-1 patients in cardiopulmonary arrest (non-traumatic) are 
transported to the most appropriate facility that is staffed, equipped, and 
prepared to perform resuscitative measures. 
 
This policy does not apply to traumatic arrest or to decompression 
emergencies. For traumatic arrest, refer to Ref. No. 506, Trauma Triage. For 
decompression emergencies, refer to Ref. No. 518, Decompression 
Emergencies/Patient Destination. 
 
AUTHORITY: Health & Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections, 1798  
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Cardiac Etiology: Sudden cardiac death from ischemic heart disease, congenital heart 
disease, channelopathy, or dysrhythmia. One presumes cardiac etiology when it is a sudden 
event without evidence of alternate causes (e.g. trauma, terminal illness, overdose, sepsis, 
drowning, or respiratory arrest). 
 
Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) Receiving Center: A licensed 
general acute care facility that is designated by the Los Angeles County EMS Agency as a 
STEMI Receiving Center, meets all the requirements listed in this policy and has been 
designated by the LA County EMS Agency as an ECPR receiving center. 
 
Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC): The restoration of a spontaneous perfusing 
rhythm. Signs of ROSC include: palpable pulse, breathing (more than an occasional gasp), a 
measurable blood pressure and/or a sudden rise in capnography to a normal/high reading. 
 
ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI): An acute myocardial infarction that generates 
ST-segment elevation on the prehospital 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). 
 
STEMI Receiving Center (SRC): An acute care facility licensed for a cardiac catheterization 
laboratory and cardiovascular surgery by the California Department of Public Health and 
designated by the Los Angeles County EMS Agency as a SRC. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. In all cases, the health and well-being of the patient is the overriding consideration in 
determining patient destination. Factors to be considered include: clinical presentation, 
severity and stability of the patient’s condition; current status of the SRC; anticipation of 
transport time; and request by the patient, family, guardian or physician. 

SUBJECT: CARDIAC ARREST (NON-TRAUMATIC) REFERENCE NO. 516 
 PATIENT DESTINATION 
 
 PAGE 378 OF 447 
 
 
 
2. Optimal  post  cardiac  arrest treatment may  include  an  interventional  cardiac  procedure  in  a 
significant percentage of patients. 
 
3. Resuscitation  efforts  for  patients  greater  than  14  years  of  age  who  are  in  non-traumatic 
cardiopulmonary arrest should take place in the field until ROSC is achieved or the patient is 
pronounced. Transport of patients without ROSC is discouraged with the exception of patients 
who meet ECPR criteria, and are transported on a mechanical compression device.  
 
4. For cardiac arrest in patients age 14 and younger, refer to Ref. No. 510, Pediatric Patient 
Destination. 
 
5. Patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation (3 or more shocks) or EMS witnessed arrests 
of presumed cardiac etiology may benefit from transport to the SRC for consideration of 
percutaneous coronary intervention despite prolonged resuscitation. 
 
6. Patients in cardiac arrest with hanging or submersion mechanisms are asphyxial in the large 
majority of cases and should be considered a medical cardiac arrest for field management 
and transport destination unless there is strong evidence of cervical spine injury.  
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Establish base hospital contact for medical direction for all cardiac arrest patients who 
do not meet criteria for determination of death per Ref. No. 814, 
Determination/Pronouncement of Death in the Field. 
 
II. For patients with STEMI complicated by out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, direct contact with 
the receiving SRC shall be established for patient notification and/or to discuss cath lab 
activation criteria. 
 
III. Patients with non-traumatic cardiac arrest who meet ALL of the following criteria should 
be transported to the closest ECPR Receiving Center if ground transport is 30 minutes 
or less regardless of service area boundaries: 
 
A. Age ≥15 to ≤75 years old 
 
B. Mechanical compression device (MCD) is available and the patient’s body 
habitus can accommodate the use of the device 
 
C. Initial shockable rhythm with refractory or recurrent ventricular 
fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia OR presumed massive pulmonary embolus 
given clinical circumstances of the arrest 
 
D. Scene time can be limited to no more than 15 minutes (no system or patient 
factors that will significantly delay transport) 
 
E. The patient does NOT: have a do-not-resuscitate order, known terminal illness, 
or baseline severe neurologic dysfunction. 
 

SUBJECT: CARDIAC ARREST (NON-TRAUMATIC) REFERENCE NO. 516 
 PATIENT DESTINATION 
 
 PAGE 379 OF 447 
 
IV. For transports to the ECPR receiving center, contact should be made directly with the 
receiving ECPR center as soon as possible while en route. 
 
V. Patients with non-traumatic cardiac arrest who do not meet ECPR criteria shall be 
transported to the most accessible SRC if ground transport is 30 minutes or less 
regardless of service area boundaries including: 
 
A. Patients with sustained ROSC 
 
B. Patients with ROSC who re-arrest en route 
 
C. Patients with persistent cardiac arrest for whom the Base Physician determines 
transport is required, because futility is not met despite lack of ROSC with on 
scene resuscitation 
 
D. Patients transported on Base judgment for ECPR when the closest SRC is an 
ECPR receiving center 
 
E. Patients who have progressed into cardiopulmonary arrest while en route and 
had a pre-arrest STEMI 12-lead ECG. 
 
VI. For patients who deteriorate into out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while en route to the most 
accessible receiving facility (MAR), rerouting to the closest SRC should be considered 
when feasible based on available resources and estimated transport times. 
 
VII. Cardiac arrest patients should be transported to the most accessible SRC (and ECPR 
receiving center when applicable) regardless of ED Diversion status. 
 
VIII. If ground transport time to a SRC is greater than 30 minutes, the patient shall be 
transported to the MAR. 
 
VI. For ECPR patients: If the closest ECPR receiving center is on ECPR diversion AND 
there is another ECPR center available within a 30 minute transport, consideration 
should be made to route to the next open ECPR center if total time from cardiac arrest to 
that ECPR center is less than 60 minutes. If no open ECPR center is reachable within 
these time intervals, the patient shall be transported to the closest SRC regardless of 
ECPR status. 
 
VII. If the closest SRC has requested STEMI Diversion (as per Ref. No. 503), cardiac arrest 
patients with STEMI should be transported to the next most accessible open SRC if 
ground transport time is less than 30 minutes, otherwise transport will continue to the 
closest SRC. Cardiac arrest patients without STEMI should be routed to the closest SRC 
regardless of ED or STEMI Diversion status.

PURPOSE: To provide a procedure for transporting patients with potential decompression 
emergencies to the most appropriate and accessible medical facility. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Provider Agency, Base Hospital and the Medic Alert Center shall follow the procedures 
outlined in the sections specific to their role. 
 
2. Patient destination for patients with decompression emergencies shall be determined by 
the hyperbaric chamber physician on-call with an exception as specified in Policy I.D. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Responsibilities of the Provider Agency: 
 
A. Contact assigned base hospital for any patient suspected of having a 
decompression emergency. 
 
B. Obtain dive incident history of the patient and dive partner, if possible. This 
includes: 
 
1. Maximum dive depth 
 
2. Time spent at depth 
 
3. Rate of ascent 
 
4. Number of dives 
 
5. Surface interval 
 
6. Gas(es) used 
 
C. Coordinate patient transportation to the appropriate receiving facility. 
 
Transportation of patients with potential decompression emergencies may 
involve the United States Coast Guard (USCG) helicopter which does not include 
paramedic level staffing. In some circumstances, the USCG helicopter may be 
able to accommodate a Los Angeles County paramedic to accompany the 
patient to the receiving facility. If this is not possible and rapid transport is in the 
best interest of the patient, care may be transferred from the paramedics 
handling the call to the USCG medical personnel.

D. In rare instances, EMTs may determine destination to the Catalina Hyperbaric 
Chamber when ALS level of care is not immediately available in remote locations 
(e.g., offshore oil and gas platforms), and patient is found either unconscious, 
apneic, pulseless, or exhibiting symptoms of suspected decompression illness 
due to premature ascent and failure to complete required underwater 
decompression stops. In such cases, notification shall be made by the on-scene 
personnel (or notification relayed by US Coast Guard directly to the Catalina 
Hyperbaric Chamber) as follows: 
 
1. Catalina Hyperbaric Chamber at (310) 510-1053 
 
2. Los Angeles County Baywatch Isthmus lifeguard paramedics (if not 
already aware of the incident) 
 
3. Medical Alert Center (MAC) 
 
E. Retrieve patient’s dive equipment (e.g., dive computer, regulator, tank, buoyancy 
compensator, gauges and weight belt) and transport with patient. If the 
transporting unit cannot accommodate the equipment, the provider agency shall 
take custody of it and notify the receiving facility of the dive equipment location. 
 
As a general rule, the integrity of the dive equipment should be maintained and 
not tampered with except by investigating authorities. 
 
II. Responsibilities of the Base Hospital Physician or Mobile Intensive Care Nurse (MICN): 
 
A. Contact the Medical Alert Center (MAC) by dialing the general number  
(866) 940-4401; select Option 1 for emergency or consultation.  The MAC will 
arrange a call between the hyperbaric chamber physician on call and the base 
hospital. If the hyperbaric physician has not responded within 10 minutes, the 
base hospital should re-contact the MAC. 
 
B. Provide medical orders for patient care. 
 
C. In consultation with the hyperbaric chamber physician on call (arranged through 
the MAC), determine if the patient should be transported directly from the 
incident location to a hyperbaric chamber or to the most accessible receiving 
facility (MAR). The following guidelines should be considered for any patient with 
a history of recent underwater compressed gas use: 
 
1. Transport to a MAC-listed hyperbaric chamber (Immediate): 
 
a. Unconscious, or 
 
b. Apneic, or 
 
c. Pulseless; or

d. Premature ascent with reported failure to complete any required 
underwater decompression stop(s) (omitted decompression) with 
or without symptoms. 
 
2. Transport to a MAC-listed hyperbaric chamber or the MAR after 
consultation with the hyperbaric chamber physician (Emergent): 
 
a. Any neurological symptoms, or 
 
b. Severe dyspnea, or 
 
c. Chest discomfort 
 
3. Transport to the MAR with potential secondary transfer to a hyperbaric 
chamber after consultation with the hyperbaric chamber physician (Non-
Emergent): 
 
a. Delayed symptoms after flying, or 
 
b. Delayed minor symptoms after 24 hours 
 
4. Patient destination for patients with decompression emergencies shall be 
determined by the hyperbaric chamber physician on call. 
 
III. Responsibilities of the MAC: 
 
A. Contact the hyperbaric chamber physician on call at LAC+USC Medical Center 
and arrange communications between the physician and the base hospital 
directing the call. If there has been no response from the LAC+USC hyperbaric 
physician within 10 minutes, the MAC will call the next hyperbaric physician on 
the list. 
 
B. Following consultation with the hyperbaric physician on call, determine which 
hyperbaric chamber is most appropriate to the needs of the patient. Factors to be 
considered include distance; altitude; weather; ETA of available transportation; 
the limitations of various aircraft; and the condition of the patient. 
 
C. Inform the appropriate receiving facility of the patient’s condition and ETA. 
 
D. Coordinate the hyperbaric chamber personnel’s transportation to the chamber.

impression of Behavioral/Psychiatric Crisis to the most appropriate facility 
that is staffed, equipped and prepared to administer medical care appropriate 
to the needs of the patient. 
 
AUTHORITY: Health & Safety Code, Division 5, Sections 1797.220, 1798 
 California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 5 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Behavioral/Psychiatric Crisis: A provider impression for patients who are having a mental 
health crisis or a mental health emergency. This is not for anxiety or agitation secondary to 
medical etiology. 
 
Emergency Medical Condition: A condition or situation in which an individual has an 
immediate need for medical attention. The presence of abnormal vital signs (heart rate and 
rhythm, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation – except isolated asymptomatic 
hypertension) are also indications of an emergency medical condition. Patients who meet any 
criteria for Base Contact or Receiving Hospital Notification (Ref. No. 1200.2) are also 
considered to have an emergency medical condition. 
 
Mental Health Crisis: Is a non-life-threatening situation in which an individual is exhibiting 
extreme emotional disturbance or behavioral distress, considering harm to self or others, 
disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a compromised ability to function, or is otherwise 
agitated and unable to be calmed. Examples of mental health crisis includes: 
 
• Talking about suicide threats 
• Talking about threatening behavior 
• Self-injury, but not needing immediate medical attention 
• Alcohol or substance abuse 
• Highly erratic or unusual behavior 
• Eating disorders 
• Not taking their prescribed psychiatric medications 
• Emotionally distraught, very depressed, angry or anxious 
 
Mental Health Emergency: Is a life-threatening situation in which an individual is imminently 
threatening harm to self or others, severely disoriented or out of touch with reality, has a severe 
inability to function, or is otherwise distraught and out of control. Examples of a mental health 
emergency includes:

1200 Table of Contents 
• Acting on a suicide threat 
• Homicidal or threatening behavior 
• Self-injury needing immediate medical attention 
• Severely impaired by drugs or alcohol 
• Highly erratic or unusual behavior that indicates very unpredictable behavior 
and/or inability to care for themselves 
 
Most Accessible Receiving Facility (MAR): Is the geographically closest (by distance) 9-1-1 
Receiving Hospital approved by the EMS Agency to receive patients with emergency medical 
conditions from the 9-1-1 system. 
 
Psychiatric Urgent Care Center (PUCC): A mental health facility authorized by the 
Department of Mental Health and approved by the EMS Agency by meeting the requirements in 
Ref. No. 326, Psychiatric Urgent Care Center Standards. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. EMS provider agencies must be approved by the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
Agency to triage patients with behavioral/psychiatric crisis to a designated PUCC. 
 
2. Patients experiencing a behavioral/psychiatric crisis who have altered level of 
consciousness (ALOC) must be transported to an emergency department for evaluation. 
 
3. Paramedics who have completed an 8-hour educational session regarding the triage of 
patients to a PUCC are the only EMS personnel authorized to utilize this policy. 
 
4. Patients exhibiting mental health crisis who meet PUCC inclusion criteria may also be 
released at the scene to the local law enforcement agency. Law enforcement officers are 
highly encouraged to transport these patients to a designated PUCC. Paramedics shall 
document on the EMS Report Form to whom the patient was released. 
 
5. Patients receiving olanzapine who are cooperative and meet the criteria for screening as 
per Ref. 526.1 Medical Clearance Criteria Screening Tool for Psychiatric Urgent Care 
Center (PUCC), may be transported by EMS (basic life support) or released to law 
enforcement to the PUCC. 
 
6. In instances where there is a potential for the patient to harm self or others, EMS 
personnel shall consider seeking assistance from law enforcement. 
 
7. Any patient who meets the triage criteria for transport to a PUCC, but who requests to be 
transported to an emergency department of a general acute care hospital, shall be 
transported to the emergency department of a general acute care hospital.  
 
8. In all cases, the health and well-being of the patient is the overriding consideration in 
determining patient destination. Factors to be considered include severity and stability of 
the patient’s illness or injury; status of the receiving facility; anticipated transport time; 
requests by the patient, family, guardian or physician; and EMS personnel and base 
hospital judgment.

POLICY: 
 
VIII. EMS Record Completion – Paramedic/EMT Personnel 
 
A. EMS providers shall document prehospital care according to procedures 
identified in the LA-EMS National Emergency Medical Services Information 
System (NEMSIS) Data Dictionary.  
 
B. Electronic EMS Patient Care Record (ePCR) Completion 
 
1.  Paramedic/EMT personnel shall complete one EMS Agency approved 
ePCR (one for each patient) for every EMS response which includes the 
following: 
 
a. Patient contact made 
b. Cancelled on scene 
c. Cancelled prior to arrival at scene 
d. No patient contact 
e. No patient found

1. Paramedic/EMT personnel may document on a paper-based EMS Report 
Form if ePCR system failure occurs.  
 
2. Private EMS providers shall utilize a paper-based EMS Report Form only 
for patients where base contact is made unless approved to electronically 
submit ePCR data. 
 
 D. Multiple Providers 
 
1. In the event of an automatic or mutual aid incident when two first 
responding providers have each completed an EMS Record, or patient 
care is  transferred from one ALS provider agency to another, each 
provider agency shall document the Original Sequence Number from the 
other provider’s patient care record in the space designated for Second 
Sequence Number. DO NOT cross out or line through the imprinted 
Sequence Number if utilizing  a paper EMS Report Form. 
 
2. The provider agency transferring patient care must have a mechanism in 
place to provide immediate transfer of patient information to the 
transporting agency. 
  
E. Multiple Casualty Incidents (MCI) 
 
1. One standard EMS Record must be initiated for each patient transported 
in an MCI.  Provider agencies may use alternate means of documenting 
MCIs if the EMS Agency is notified prior to implementation and agrees 
with the proposed process. 
 

SUBJECT: DOCUMENTATION OF PREHOSPITAL CARE REFERENCE NO. 606 
 
 
 PAGE 395 OF 447 
 
1200 Table of Contents 
 
2. Documentation should include the following, at minimum: 
a. Name 
b. Provider Impression 
c. Chief Complaint 
d. Mechanism of Injury, if applicable 
e. Age and units of age 
f. Gender 
g. Brief patient assessment 
h. Brief description of treatment provided 
i. Transporting provider (provider code and unit number) and level of 
service (ALS, BLS or Helicopter) 
j. Destination 
k. Receiving facility 
 
3. Non-transported patients should be documented on a standard EMS 
Record, or a patient log. 
 
4. Each provider agency should submit copies of all records and logs 
pertaining to an MCI to the EMS Agency within 10 business days of the 
incident. MCI documents should be hand carried or delivered to the EMS 
Agency in an envelope clearly marked with the incident date and location. 
 
 F. Completion of the EMS Record Prior to Distribution 
 
1. EMTs and paramedics responsible for documenting prehospital care shall 
ensure that EMS Records are completed in their entirety prior to 
dissemination to the receiving facility. In most instances, this means that 
the form is completed at the scene or upon arrival at the receiving facility. 
 
2. An exception to this is when a first responding agency is utilizing paper-
based EMS Report Forms is giving the receiving hospital (red) copy to a 
transporting agency. In the interest of expediting the transfer of care, it is 
recognized that information such as the unit times may not be 
documented on the receiving hospital (red) copy of the EMS Report 
Form. 
 
  G. Field Transfer of Care 
 
1. When patient care has been transferred from the first responding ALS or 
BLS provider agency to a BLS provider agency for transport to a receiving 
facility, the provider agency receiving the patient should NOT generate an 
ePCR with a new Sequence Number (this will result in the same patient 
being entered into the ESO Repository with two different sequence 
numbers). 
 
2. The provider agency that receives the BLS patient for transport to a 
receiving facility shall complete their agency’s ePCR and document the 
Sequence Number generated by the first responding ALS or BLS provider 
agency’s ePCR on their ePCR or paper-based EMS Report Form.

1200 Table of Contents 
 
3. If utilizing a paper-based EMS Report Form, the receiving hospital (red) 
copy of the EMS Report Form, as well as the PCR from the BLS transport 
provider (red copy), must accompany the patient to the receiving facility 
where it becomes part of the patient’s medical record. 
 
4. It is the responsibility of the EMS Provider to ensure that a completed 
copy of the EMS Record is provided to the receiving facility upon transfer 
of care. 
 
 H. Completion of Advanced Life Support Continuation Form 
 
1. If utilizing a paper-based EMS Report Form, required for each patient on 
whom advanced airway management is necessary. 
 
2. Paramedics completing this form must ensure that the demographic 
information (patient name, date, provider code/unit, incident#) and 
Sequence Number are legibly and accurately transcribed from the EMS 
Report Form. 
 
II. Base Hospital Form - MICN and/or Physicians 
 
A. Base hospital personnel (MICNs and physicians) shall document prehospital care 
according to procedures identified in the Base Hospital Documentation Manual. 
 
B. Base Hospital Form Completion 
 
1. MICNs and/or physicians shall complete one EMS Agency approved Base 
Hospital Form (one for each patient in which medical direction is given) for 
every base hospital paramedic radio/telephone contact. 
 
2. MICNs and/or physicians may document and submit base hospital data 
electronically in lieu of the standard Base Hospital Form if the base hospital 
has received prior authorization from the EMS Agency.   
 
C. Base Hospital Directed Multiple Casualty Incidents (MCI) 
 
1. EMS Agency-approved MCI Base Hospital Forms may be utilized for 
incidents involving three or more patients. 
 
2. Physicians and MICNs should limit requested information to only that 
which is essential to determine destination or medical management.  
Additional information and Sequence Numbers should be obtained after  
the MCI has cleared. 
 
3. The following should be documented for MCIs involving three or more 
patients: 
 
a. Date 

SUBJECT: DOCUMENTATION OF PREHOSPITAL CARE REFERENCE NO. 606 
 
 
 PAGE 397 OF 447 
 
b. Time

e. Chief complaint 
f. Mechanism of injury, if applicable 
g. Age and units of age 
h. Gender 
i. Brief patient assessment when possible 
j. Brief description of treatment provided, when possible 
k. Transporting provider, method of transport (ALS, BLS or 
Helicopter) 
l. Destination 
m. Receiving Facility 
 
4. Upon request of the EMS Agency the base hospital should submit all 
records pertaining to an MCI to the EMS Agency within 10 business days. 
 
5. Provider agencies may use alternate means of reporting MCIs. Base 
Hospitals will be notified by the EMS Agency when alternate reporting 
methods will be implemented by various provider agencies. 
 
6. MCIs involving ONLY BLS patients: BLS patients who are transported to 
a receiving facility should be documented on one Base Hospital Form in 
the Comments Section (provided no medical direction is given). 
 
7. MCIs involving ALS and BLS Patients:   
 
   a. One standard Base Hospital Form or one EMS Agency-approved  
    MCI Base Hospital Form must be completed for each ALS patient.  
 
   c. BLS patients on whom no medical direction has been   
    given do not require a Base Hospital Form. The number and  
    disposition of the BLS patients may be documented on the Base  
    Hospital Form of an ALS patient in the Comments Section. 
 
8. Alternate methods of documenting MCIs may be initiated by base 
hospitals with the approval of the EMS Agency. 
 
III. Modification of the EMS Report Form  
 
A. Modifying the EMS Report Form (additions, deletions or changes) after the form 
has been completed or disseminated: 
 
1. An audit trail of changes made to an electronic record will be included 
on the ePCR. 
 
2. For paper-based EMS Report Forms, make corrections by drawing a 
single line through the incorrect item or narrative (the writing underneath 
the single line must remain readable). 

SUBJECT: DOCUMENTATION OF PREHOSPITAL CARE REFERENCE NO. 606 
 
 
 PAGE 398 OF 447 
 
 
 
1200 Table of Contents 
 
Make the changes on the original, noting the date and time the changes 
were made, with the signature of the individual making the changes 
adjacent to the correction. Ideally, changes should be made by the 
individual who initially completed the form. Under no circumstances 
should changes to either patient assessment or patient treatment 
documentation be made by an individual who did not participate in the 
response.). 
 
B. Making substantive changes (documentation of additional medications, 
defibrillation attempts, pertinent comments, complaints, etc.) to the EMS 
Record: 
 
1. For electronic documentation systems, patient care related corrections 
are to be made as per provider agency policy. Provider agency shall 
notify its’ receiving hospital(s) of the mechanism by which ePCRs are 
updated and when an ePCR is updated. If the receiving hospital 
receives a printed copy of the record, a printed copy of the revised 
record will be provided directly to them. 
 
2. Photocopy the paper-based EMS Report Form with the changes and 
send the copy, along with a cover letter, to all entities that received the 
original form (EMS Agency, receiving facility). The cover letter should 
explain the modifications and request that the modified copy be 
attached to the original copy. 
 
3. Do not re-write the incident on a new paper-based EMS Report Form 
because this would result in a mismatch in Sequence Number. If the 
form requiring corrections has been mutilated or soiled and cannot be 
photocopied, then a new form may be used to re-write the incident 
provided the Sequence Number of the new form has been replaced with 
the Sequence Number from the original form.

the MAR. The rationale for the decision to transport shall be documented on the EMS 
patient care record. 
 
5. EMT personnel may immediately transport hypotensive patients with life-threatening, 
penetrating injuries to the torso to the closest trauma center, not the most accessible 
receiving (MAR), when the transport time is less than the estimated time of ALS arrival. 
The transporting unit should make every effort to contact the receiving trauma center. 
 
6. If EMT personnel encounter a life-threatening situation (unmanageable airway or 
uncontrollable hemorrhage), they should exercise their clinical judgment as to whether it 
is in the patient’s best interest to transport the patient prior to the arrival of an ALS unit if 
their estimated time of arrival (ETA) exceeds the ETA to the MAR. The rationale for the 
decision to transport shall be documented on an EMS patient care record.

PURPOSE: This policy is intended to provide EMS personnel with parameters to 
determine whether or not to withhold resuscitative efforts in accordance with 
the patient’s wishes, and to provide guidelines for base hospital physicians 
to discontinue resuscitative efforts and pronounce death. 
 
AUTHORITY: California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5 
California Probate Code, Division 4.7 
California Family Code, Section 297-297.5 
California Health and Safety Code, Division 1, Part 1.8, Section 443 et seq. 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Advance Health Care Directive (AHCD): A written document that allows patients who are 
unable to speak for themselves to provide health care instructions and/or appoint a Power-of- 
Attorney for Health Care. There is no one standard format for an AHCD. Examples of AHCDs 
include: 
 
• Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare (DPAHC) 
• Healthcare proxies 
• Living wills (valid in California if dated prior to 7-1-2000; advisory but not legally 
binding after that date) 
 
Agent: An individual, eighteen years of age or older, designated in a durable power of 
attorney for health care to make health care decisions for the patient, also known as 
“attorney-in-fact”. 
 
Aid-in-Dying Drug: A drug determined and prescribed by a physician for a qualified 
individual, which the qualified individual may choose to self-administer to bring about his or 
her death due to terminal illness. The prescribed drug may take effect within minutes to 
several days after self-administration. 
 
Conservator: Court-appointed authority to make health care decisions for a patient. 
 
Determination of Death: To conclude that a patient has died by conducting an assessment to 
confirm the absence of respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic function. 
 
End of Life Option Act: This California state law authorizes an adult, eighteen years or 
older, who meets certain qualifications, and who has been determined by his or her 
attending physician to be suffering from a terminal disease to make a request for an “aid-in-
dying drug” prescribed for the purpose of ending his or her life in a humane and dignified 
manner.

Immediate Family: The spouse, domestic partner, parent, adult children, adult sibling(s), or 
family member intimately involved in the care of the patient. member intimately involved in the care 
of the patient.  
 
Organized ECG Activity: A sinus, atrial or junctional (supraventricular) rhythm. 
 
Pronouncement of Death: A formal declaration by a base hospital physician that life has 
ceased. 
 
Standardized Patient-Designated Directives: Forms or medallions that recognize and 
accommodate a patient’s wish to limit prehospital treatment at home, in long term care 
facilities, or during transport between facilities. Examples include: 
 
• Statewide Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA)/California Medical 
Association (CMA) Prehospital DNR Form (Ref. No. 815.1) 
• Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST, Ref. No. 815.2)

PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Resuscitative efforts are of no benefit to patients whose physical condition precludes any 
possibility of successful resuscitation. 
 
2. EMTs and paramedics may determine death based on specific criteria set forth in this 
policy. 
 
3. Base hospital physicians may pronounce death based on information provided by the 
paramedics in the field and guidelines set forth in this policy. 
 
4. If there is any objection or disagreement by family members or EMS personnel regarding 
terminating or withholding resuscitation, basic life support (BLS) resuscitation, including 
defibrillation, may continue or begin immediately and paramedics should contact the 
base hospital for further directions. 
 
5. Aggressive resuscitation in the field to obtain the return of spontaneous circulation 
(ROSC) is encouraged. Transporting patients without ROSC is discouraged with the 
exception of patients who meet ECPR criteria and are transported on a mechanical 
compression device. 
 
6. EMS personnel should honor valid do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders and other patient 
designated end-of-life directives in the field and act in accordance with the patient’s 
wishes when death appears imminent. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. EMS personnel may determine death in the following circumstances: 
 
A. In addition to the absence of respiration, cardiac activity, and neurologic 
reflexes, one or more of the following physical or circumstantial conditions

assessment, are found apneic, pulseless, asystolic, and without pupillary 
reflexes upon the arrival of EMS personnel at the scene. 
 
8. Blunt trauma patients who, based on a paramedic’s thorough patient 
assessment, are found apneic, pulseless, and without organized ECG 
activity (sinus, atrial or junctional rhythm) due to traumatic mechanism 
upon the arrival of EMS personnel at the scene. 
 
a. For patients with shockable ventricular rhythm, defibrillate as per 
TP 1243/1243-P in attempt to restore organized ECG activity 
prior to determination of death. 
 
9. Pulseless, non-breathing victims of a multiple victim incident where 
insufficient medical resources preclude initiating resuscitative measures. 
 
10. Drowning victims, when it is reasonably determined that submersion 
has been greater than one hour. 
 
11. Rigor mortis (requires assessment as described in Section I, B.) 
 
12. Post-mortem lividity (requires assessment as described in Section I, B.) 
 
B. If the initial assessment reveals rigor mortis and/or post-mortem lividity only, 
EMTs and/or paramedics shall perform the following assessments (may be 
performed concurrently) to confirm the absence of respiratory, cardiac, and 
neurologic function for determination of death in the field: 
 
1. Assessment of respiratory status: 
 
a. Assure that the patient has an open airway.

2
 
Paramedics should stabilize the patient on scene after ROSC (for 
approximately 5 minutes) per TP 1210 and initiate transport once ROSC is 
maintained. 
 
2. The patient is determined to be an ECPR candidate and has not achieved 
ROSC despite initial on scene resuscitation (scene time limited to ≤15 
minutes prior to transport). 
 
3. Base physician determines further resuscitative efforts are futile 
 
B. Patients who have NOT maintained ROSC after on-scene resuscitation and 
stabilization should NOT be transported unless the Base physician determines 
transport is indicated and/or the patient meets ECPR criteria.  
 
1. Early transport for patients with ongoing resuscitation is NOT advised.   
 
2. The decision to transport a patient with refractory OHCA should be 
based on the availability of therapies at the receiving center that are not

To access the patient, it may be necessary to ask law enforcement officers 
for assistance to create a “safe path” that minimizes scene contamination. 
 
C. If law enforcement is not on scene, EMS personnel should attempt to 
create a "safe path" and secure the scene until law enforcement arrives. 
V. Procedures Following Pronouncement of Death 
 
A. The deceased should not be moved without the coroner’s authorization. Any 
invasive equipment (i.e., intravenous line, endotracheal tube) used on the 
patient should be left in place. 
 
 
NOTE: If it is necessary to move the deceased because the scene is 
unsafe, the body is creating a hazard, or the body is at risk of 
loss through fire or flood, the EMS personnel may relocate the 
deceased to a safer location, or transport to the most 
accessible receiving facility. 
 
B. If law enforcement or the coroner confirms that the deceased will not be a 
coroner’s case and the personal physician is going to sign the death certificate, 
any invasive equipment used during the resuscitation may be removed. 
 
C. EMS  personnel  should  remain  on  scene  until  law  enforcement  arrives. 
During this time, when appropriate, the provider should provide grief support 
to family members. 
 
VI. Required Documentation for Patients Determined Dead/Pronounced in the Field 
 
A. The time and criteria utilized to determine death; the condition, location and 
position of the body, and any care provided. 
 
B. The location and the rationale if the deceased was moved. If the coroner 
authorized movement of the deceased, document the coroner's case number (if 
available) and the coroner’s representative who authorized the movement. 
 
C. Time of pronouncement and name of the pronouncing physician if base 
hospital contact was initiated 
 
D. The name of the agent identified in the AHCD or patient-designated directive or 
the name of the immediate family member who made the decision to withhold 
or withdraw resuscitative measures. Obtain their signature on the EMS Report 
Form.

PURPOSE: To provide guidelines and procedures for prehospital care personnel to report 
suspected child abuse. 
 
AUTHORITY: California Penal Code, Chapter 916, Sections 11164-11174.3 
County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family 
Services 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Agencies authorized to accept mandated reports: Any police department or sheriff’s 
department, and the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) Child Protection 
Hotline (CPH). School district police and security departments are not authorized to accept 
reports. 
 
Child: Any person less than eighteen years of age. 
 
Mandated reporter: Any healthcare practitioner, childcare custodian, or an employee of a 
child protective agency. This includes EMTs and paramedics. 
 
Neglect: The negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child by a person responsible for the 
child’s welfare under circumstances indicating harm or threatened harm to the child’s 
health or welfare. The term includes both acts and omissions on the part of the responsible 
person. 
 
Physical abuse: Physical injury or death inflicted by other than accidental means upon a 
child by another person. 
 
Sexual abuse: Sexual assault or the exploitation of a minor. Sexual assault includes, but is 
not limited to, any intrusion by one person into the genitals; anal opening of a child; oral 
copulation intentional touching for the purposes of sexual arousal or gratification, or 
masturbation in the presence of a child. Sexual exploitation includes conduct involving 
matters depicting minors engaged in obscene acts; and/or prostitution. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. The purpose of reporting suspected child abuse/neglect is to protect the child, 
prevent further abuse of the child and other children in the home, and to 
facilitate treatment for the entire family. The presence of abuse, rather than 
the degree of that abuse, is the determinant for intervention by DCFS and law 
enforcement. 
2. California Penal Code, Sections 11166 and 11168, require mandated 
reporters to promptly report all suspected non-accidental injuries, sexual 
abuse, or neglect of children that they suspect, have knowledge of, or 
observe in their professional capacity. A verbal report shall be made to 
DCFS Child Protection Hotline immediately, or as soon as practically 
possible, and the Suspected Child Abuse Report shall be completed within 
36 hours.

 REPORTING GUIDELINES

1200 Table of Contents 
 
In Los Angeles County, it is recommended that a report be made to local 
law enforcement as well. 
 
3. It is not necessary for the mandated reporter to determine child abuse but only 
to suspect that it may have occurred. Law enforcement, DCFS and the courts 
determine whether child abuse/neglect has, in fact, occurred. 
 
4. Current law mandates (CPC 11166) all healthcare professionals to report 
suspected child abuse/neglect that they know of or observe in their 
professional capacity. Mandated reporters are required to sign a statement 
acknowledging their understanding of the law (See Ref. No. 822.3, Sample 
Employee Acknowledgement as a Mandated Reporter). Any person who fails to 
report as required may be punished by a fine or imprisonment. 
 
5. When  a  mandated  reporter  suspects  or  has  observed  child  abuse/neglect, 
that  individual  is  required  to  report  by  telephone  to  local  law  enforcement 
and/or to DCFS Child Protection Hotline. 
 
6. When two or more mandated reporters are present at scene and jointly know 
or suspect an instance of child abuse/neglect, a member of the reporting team 
may be designated to report on behalf of the team. Any member who knows 
that the designated reporter failed to uphold their agreement shall thereafter 
make the report. If paramedics are not selected as the designated reporters, 
they shall document the name and agency of the designated reporting team 
member on the EMS Report Form. 
 
7. Persons legally required to report suspected child abuse are immune 
from criminal or civil liability for reporting as required. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Reporting Procedure 
 
A. Notify local law enforcement immediately if a child is suspected to be in 
imminent danger. Prehospital care providers should be aware of their local law 
enforcement reporting procedures and telephone numbers for notification. 
 
B. Call the 24-hour Child Protection Hotline at (800) 540-4000 as soon as 
possible to make the verbal report. (Refer to 822.1 for reporting options and 
instructions). 
 
DCFS has implemented the Child Protection Hotline Priority line for Medical 
Providers to ensure immediate connection to the Hotline. Upon dialing the 
hotline number listed above, press * within the first 10 seconds of the call and 
a prompt will request a code be entered. Enter the code 3237 (DCFS). Once 
the code is entered, the caller will be given options to select.

PURPOSE: To provide guidelines for EMS personnel to determine which patients who do 
not wish to be transported to the hospital have decision-making capacity to 
refuse EMS treatment and/or transport, and to identify those who may be safely 
released at scene. 
 
AUTHORITY: California Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections 1797.220, 1798, (a). 
California Welfare and Institution Code, Sections 305, 625, 5150, and 5170. 
Title 22, California Code of Regulations, Section 100169. 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Adult: A person at least eighteen years of age. 
 
Against Medical Advice (AMA): A patient or a legal representative of a patient who has 
decision-making capacity and who refuses treatment and/or transport for an emergency 
medical condition as advised by EMS providers, physician on scene, and/or Base personnel. 
 
Assess, Treat, and Release: A patient who does not desire transport to the emergency 
department for evaluation and after an assessment and/or treatment by EMS personnel, does 
not have an ongoing emergent medical condition, a high-risk presentation, or social risk factors 
and is released at scene to follow-up with the patient’s regular healthcare provider or a doctor’s 
office or clinic. 
 
Authorized Advanced Health Care Provider: An EMS physician authorized to direct EMS 
care on the scene or via telemedicine as per Ref. 816 – Physician at the Scene, or an advanced 
practiced provider who is identified by the EMS Provider Agency Medical Director to provide 
medical direction via telemedicine as approved by the EMS Agency Medical Director. 
 
Decision-Making Capacity: The ability to understand the nature and consequences of 
proposed health care. This includes understanding the significant risks and benefits and having 
the ability to make and communicate a decision regarding the proposed health care in the 
patient’s primary language, if feasible. A person has decision-making capacity if they are able 
to: 
• Communicate the need for treatment, the implications of receiving and of not receiving 
treatment, and alternative forms of treatment that are available, and 
• Relate the above information to their personal values, and then make and convey a 
decision. 
 
The lack of decision-making capacity may be: 
• Temporarily lost (e.g., due to unconsciousness, influence of mind-altering

• substances, mental illness, or cognitive impairment) 
• Permanently lost (e.g., due to irreversible coma, persistent vegetative state, 
untreatable brain injury, or dementia) 
• Never existed (e.g., due to profound neurodevelopmental disorder, those who are 
deemed by the Court as incompetent or a person under conservatorship) 
 
Emancipated Minor: A person under the age of 18 years is an emancipated minor if any of the 
following conditions are met: 
• Married or previously married 
• Currently or previously in a valid domestic partnership  
• On active military duty 
• The person has received a declaration of emancipation pursuant to Section 7122 of the 
California Family Code, which includes all of the following: at least fourteen (14) years of 
age, living separate and apart from their parents and managing their own financial affairs 
(may be verified by DMV Identification Card) 
 
Emergency Medical Condition: A condition or situation in which a medical illness is suspected 
in a patient and there is an immediate need for medical attention. Patients with any abnormal 
vital signs: heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, blood pressure (except for isolated 
asymptomatic hypertension), oxygen saturation, and temperature (Ref. 1380 – Medical Control 
Guideline Vital Signs); and/or those who meet any criteria for Base Contact (Ref. 1200.2 – Base 
Contact Requirements) are considered to have an emergency medical condition. 
 
High Risk Presentation: Features by history or presentation that are likely to be high risk for 
complications, progression of disease, underlying serious illness or injury, or require Base 
Contact. High risk chief complaints include chest pain, abdominal pain, pregnancy, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, syncope, neurologic symptoms (e.g., dizziness/vertigo, weakness, 
visual changes), and altered mental status. High risk features include: 
 
• Patients less than 12 months of age 
• Patients older than 70 years of age 
• Patients with complicating comorbidities (i.e., active underlying cardiac, respiratory, 
kidney, liver, oncologic (cancer) or neurologic disease, or who are immunocompromised 
(e.g., history of HIV, chemotherapy, transplantation)) 
 
Implied Consent: This is a type of consent involving the presumption that an unconscious or a 
person lacking decision-making capacity would consent to lifesaving care. This shall include 
minors with an emergency medical condition when a parent or legal representative is not 
available. 
 
Lift Assist: EMS is dispatched to a scene to assist with transfer of a patient to a bed or 
wheelchair. 
 
LPS-Evaluator: An individual that is authorized under CA WIC § 5150 et seq. to evaluate and 
place a patient on a 5150/5585 written hold application, such as all law enforcement (LE) 
personnel and clinicians who are LPS-authorized by the County Department of Mental Health. 
Examples include, Psychiatric Emergency Team (PET), Psychiatric Mobile Response Team 
(PMRT), Mental Evaluation Team (MET), Systemwide Mental Assessment Response Teams 
(SMART), or others. LPS refers to “Lanterman-Petris-Short”, the names of the original state

legislators who authored CA WIC § 5150 et seq.  
Medical Home: A team-based health care delivery model, which is led by a health care provider  
(i.e., primary care physician) to provide continuous, coordinated, and comprehensive medical 
care. 
 
Minor: A person less than eighteen years of age. 
 
Minor Not Requiring Parental Consent is a person who: 
1. Is 12 years or older and in need of care for a reportable medical condition or 
substance abuse 
2. Is pregnant and requires care related to the pregnancy 
3. Is in immediate danger of suspected physical or sexual abuse 
4. Is an emancipated minor 
 
No Contact / No Patient: EMS is dispatched to a scene and is either cancelled prior to arriving 
at scene or no patient is found. 
 
Patient: A person who seeks or appears to require medical assessment and/or medical 
treatment (Ref. 606, Documentation of Prehospital Care) 
 
Person Contact / No Patient: EMS is dispatched to a scene and a person is identified as a 
potential patient, is alert and appropriate for situation and declines assessment by EMS. 
 
Psychiatric Hold (5150 / 5585): Refers to California Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) § 
5150 et seq. which defines the legal standard for involuntary detainment and evaluation of a 
person who, as a result of a mental health disorder, is a danger to others, or to themselves, or 
gravely disabled. “5150” refers to the code for adult patients, “5585” refers to the code for 
minors (under age 18). This is a written application by an authorized LPS-evaluator certified by 
the County to place an individual on a psychiatric hold. An authorized LPS-evaluator must 
provide the written application (“psychiatric hold” document) which must accompany the patient 
to the facility where they are transported. 
 
Public Assist: EMS is dispatched to a scene for assistance for nonmedical issues involving a 
person. 
 
Released Following Protocol Guidelines: Disposition for patients who lack established 
decision-making capacity or in whom capacity cannot be determined due to inability to access 
or assess the patient, and for whom EMS personnel have exhausted all options (including law 
enforcement when appropriate) such that EMS cannot safely access and/or transport the patient 
to the hospital.  
 
Social Risk Factors: Persons experiencing homelessness, patients in congregate living, and 
those who are a resident of skilled nursing facilities. 
 
Treatment in Place: A patient who, after an assessment and treatment by EMS personnel and 
medical clearance by an authorized advanced healthcare provider (e.g., physician, nurse 
practitioner, physician assistant) on scene (Ref. 816 Physician at the Scene) or via 
Telemedicine, does not require ambulance transport to an emergency department. Appropriate 
follow-up should be arranged by the authorized advanced healthcare provider on scene or via

Telemedicine. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. An adult or emancipated minor who has decision-making capacity has the right to 
determine the course of their medical care including the refusal of care. These 
patients must be advised of the risks and consequences resulting from refusal of 
medical care. A patient less than eighteen (18) years of age, with the exception of 
minors not requiring parental consent, mush have a parent or legal representative to 
refuse evaluation, treatment, and/or transport for an emergency medical condition. 
 
2. A patient determined by EMS personnel or the base hospital to lack decision-making 
capacity may not refuse care AMA. Mental illness, drugs, alcohol, or physical/mental 
impairment may impair a patient’s decision-making capacity but are not sufficient to 
eliminate decision-making capacity. 
 
3. Patients who have attempted suicide, or who have expressed a method, a plan, or 
intent to commit suicide (MCG 1306), should receive an evaluation by an LPS-
evaluator for a psychiatric hold. LPS evaluator determination is the legal authority for 
placement or non-placement of a psychiatric hold (5150 / 5585).  
 
4. A patient on a psychiatric hold may not be released at scene and cannot sign-out 
AMA. The patient can refuse any medical treatment as long as it is not an imminent 
threat to life or limb. 
 
5. At no time are EMS personnel expected to put themselves in danger by attempting to 
treat and/or transport a patient who refuses care.  
 
6. For patients determined to lack decision-making capacity or in whom capacity cannot 
be determined due to inability to access or assess the agitated patient, EMS 
personnel should refer to MCG 1307.4, EMS and Law Enforcement Co-Response to 
follow the escalation and communication pathway to engage law enforcement’s 
assistance. 
 
7. Patients for whom 9-1-1 is called but are not transported represent a potentially high-
risk group and provider agencies should/shall have quality review programs specific 
to this patient population. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Adult With Decision-Making Capacity or Minor (Not Requiring Parental Consent) 
Refusing Transport Against Medical Advice 
 
A. EMS personnel shall advise the patient of the risks and consequences which 
may result from refusal of treatment and/or transport. The patient should be 
advised to seek immediate medical care. 
 
B. Base contact should be made prior to the patient leaving the scene for patients 
who would otherwise meet Base Contact criteria (Ref. 1200.2 – Base Contact  

SUBJECT: PATIENT REFUSAL OF TREATMENT/TRANSPORT REFERENCE NO. 834 
 AND TREAT AND RELEASE AT SCENE

1200 Table of Contents 
 
Requirements) in order for Base personnel to have the opportunity to interview 
the patient and to evaluate the appropriateness of the AMA. If the patient elopes 
from the scene, EMS personnel are not required to make Base Contact. 
 
C. EMS personnel shall relay all the circumstances to the Base including 
assessment and care rendered, reasons for refusal, and the patient’s plan for 
transportation and follow-up care. 
 
D. EMS personnel shall make Base Contact prior to releasing a child at the scene 
with a parent or caregiver for all pediatric patients less than or equal to 12 
months of age.   
 
E. EMS personnel shall have the patient or their legal representative, as 
appropriate, sign the release (AMA) section of the Patient Care Record (EMS 
Report Form/Electronic Patient Care Record/ePCR). The signature shall be 
witnessed, preferably by a family member. 
 
F. A patient’s refusal to sign the AMA section should be documented on the Patient 
Care Record. 
 
II. Individual Lacking Decision-Making Capacity or a Minor (Requiring Parental Consent) 
 
A. The patient should be transported to an appropriate receiving facility under 
implied consent. A psychiatric hold is not required. 
 
B. If EMS personnel or the base hospital determines it is necessary to transport the 
patient against their will and the patient resists, or the EMS personnel believe the 
patient will resist, assistance from law enforcement should be requested in 
transporting the patient. Law enforcement may consider the placement of a 
psychiatric hold on the patient but this is not required for transport. In cases 
where law enforcement’s decision is to not engage, EMS personnel should follow 
guidelines outlined in MCG 1307.4, EMS and Law Enforcement Co-Response. 
 
C. Law enforcement should be involved whenever EMS personnel believe a parent 
or other legal representative of the patient is acting unreasonably in refusing 
immediate care and/or transport. 
 
III. Patients Assessed, Treated, and Released 
 
A. EMS personnel shall assess the patient for an ongoing emergency medical 
condition, high risk presentations, social risk factors, and assess that the patient 
or their legal representative has the capacity to decline transport. 
 
B. Patients with an ongoing emergency medical condition, high risk presentation or 
social risk factors who do not desire transport to the emergency department shall 
be handled as refusing transport against medical advice (refer to Policy Section 
I). 
 
C. Patients or the legal representatives of patients who contact EMS for minor  

SUBJECT: PATIENT REFUSAL OF TREATMENT/TRANSPORT REFERENCE NO. 834 
 AND TREAT AND RELEASE AT SCENE 
  
 
 
 PAGE 427 OF 447 
 
1200 Table of Contents 
complaints in order to have an assessment performed and determination made 
of the seriousness of the complaint and need for treatment, but later decline 
transport qualify to be assessed, treated, and released. 
 
1. In such cases, the EMS personnel should perform an assessment 
including vital signs, and after the patient or patient’s legal 
representative’s states they do not wish transport, the patient may be 
assessed, treated, and released at the scene. 
 
2. Patients should be instructed by EMS to follow-up with the patient’s 
medical home or primary care physician. The advice given should be 
documented on the Patient Care Record. The following statement is 
recommended: “After our assessment, you feel that you do not wish to be 
transported and you do not require immediate care in the emergency 
department. You should seek care with your regular healthcare provider 
or a doctor’s office or clinic within 24 hours. If you have worsening or 
persistent symptoms or change your mind and desire transport, recontact 
9-1-1.” 
 
D. EMS personnel should not require patients who are Assessed, Treated and 
Released at scene to sign the release (AMA) section of the Patient Care Record, 
as this implies that the patient is at significant risk by not utilizing the EMS 
system for treatment and/or transportation.  
 
E. If subsequent to further assessment and discussion, the patient or the patient’s 
legal representative desires transport, EMS personnel should transport the 
patient to the hospital per destination policies. 
 
IV. Documentation 
 
A. Public Assist and Person Contact/No Patient does not require completion of a 
Patient Care Record. Documentation should follow the EMS provider agency’s 
operational policy. 
 
B.  A Patient Care Record must be completed for each patient or contact encounter 
(i.e., Lift Assist, AMA, Assess, Treat and Release, and Treatment in Place), 
including those refusing emergency medical evaluation, care and/or 
transportation against medical advice and those released at scene. EMS 
personnel shall ensure that documentation is in compliance with Ref. 606 – 
Documentation of Prehospital Care. Patient Care Record documentation should 
include: 
 
 
1. AMA: 
 
a. Patient history and assessment, including findings of an 
emergency medical condition or requirement to make Base 
Contact 
 
b. Assessment by EMS that the patient or legal representative is

who are not transported to the ED. The quality improvement program should 
include but may not be limited to the following: 
 
1. Monitor data on the frequency, percent, and type of nontransports. 
 
2. Establish a process for review of patient care records on a percentage of 
nontransports to include assessment of impact on the patient’s outcome, 
and education/training provided as indicated by this review. 
 
3. Develop a process for evaluating rate of repeat call to 9-1-1 or “rekindles”. 
 
B. Base Hospital shall incorporate patients released at the scene into their Quality 
Improvement Program (Ref. 304 – Paramedic Base Hospital Standards). The

1200 Table of Contents 
PURPOSE: To provide guidelines for emergency procedures and use of restraints in the field 
or during transport of patients who are violent or potentially violent, or who may 
harm self or others. 
 
AUTHORITY: California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 100063, 100145, 
100169(a)(1,2) and (c)(1) 
 Welfare and Institutions Code, 5150 
 California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Section 1103.2 
 Health and Safety Code, Section 1798(a) 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. The safety of the patient, community, and responding personnel is of paramount concern 
when considering the use of restraints. 
 
2. Staff should be properly trained in the appropriate use and application of restraints and 
in the monitoring of patients in restraints. 
 
3. The application of restraints is a high-risk procedure due to the possibility of injury to 
both the patient and the provider; therefore, the least restrictive method that protects the 
patient and emergency medical services (EMS) personnel from harm should be utilized.   
 
4. Restraints should be used in situations where the patient is potentially violent or is 
exhibiting behavior that is dangerous to self or others, only as necessary, when all lesser 
restrictive measures (e.g., verbal de-escalation) have failed. 
 
5. EMS personnel must consider that aggressive or violent behavior may be a symptom of 
medical conditions such as head trauma, alcohol, substance abuse, metabolic disorders, 
emotional stress and, behavioral and psychiatric disorders.  Base contact criteria shall 
be strictly adhered to for those conditions that require it. 
 
6. Authority for scene management (e.g., controlling the activities that occur in the 
environment or space around the patient; ensuring bystanders are kept away; and EMS 
personnel are provided with a safe environment to treat the patient) shall be coordinated 
by law enforcement (LE), where applicable. 
 
7. The responsibility for patient health care management rests with the highest medical 
authority on scene. Therefore, medical intervention and patient destination shall be 
determined by EMS personnel according to applicable policies. 
 
a. The preferred restraint modality should be coordinated with LE, when applicable. 
 
b. The method of restraint used should allow for adequate monitoring of vital signs 
and should not restrict the patient’s ability to breathe freely. Restraints should not

 PAGE 433 OF 447 
 
1200 Table of Contents 
 
prevent ability to protect the airway nor compromise neurological or vascular 
status. 
 
8. This policy is not intended to negate the need for LE personnel to use appropriate 
restraint equipment approved by their respective agency to establish scene 
management control. 
 
POLICY 
 
I. Forms of Restraining Devices 
 
A. Restraint devices applied by EMS personnel (including for the purpose of 
interfacility transport of psychiatric patients) must be either padded hard 
restraints or soft restraints (i.e., vest with ties, Velcro or seatbelt type).  Both 
methods must be keyless and allow for quick release.  Restraints shall be applied 
as four point padded wrist and ankle restraints, or a two-point padded wrist and 
belt restraint. 
 
B. The following methods of restraint shall NOT be utilized by EMS personnel: 
 
1. Applying hard plastic ties or any restraint device requiring a key to 
remove.   
 
2. Restraining a patient’s hands and feet behind their back. 
 
3. Restraining patients in prone position. 
 
4. Placing a patient on a gurney and then placing a device (e.g., backboard, 
scoop stretcher or flats) on top of the patient, referred to as “Sandwich” 
method. 
 
5. Applying materials in a manner that could cause vascular, neurological or 
respiratory compromise (e.g., restriction of limbs, the neck or chest using 
gauze bandage or tape). 
 
C.  In some situations, it may be necessary for LE to apply restraints (e.g., 
handcuffs, flex-cuffs, herein referred to as LE-restraint), which are not approved 
by EMS protocols. When appropriate, patients requiring ongoing patient care or 
EMS transported patients should have LE-restraints discontinued in favor of an 
EMS approved restraint intervention. 
  
II. Application and Monitoring of Restraints  
 
A. A restrained patient shall never be left unattended. 
 
B. Any restraint device used must allow for rapid removal if the patient’s airway, 
breathing, or circulation becomes compromised. 
 
C. Restrained extremities should be evaluated for pulse quality, capillary refill, color, 
temperature, nerve and motor function immediately following application and at a  

SUBJECT: APPLICATION OF PATIENT RESTRAINTS REFERENCE NO. 838 
  
 
 
 PAGE 434 OF 447 
 
1200 Table of Contents 
 
minimum of every 15 minutes thereafter (or more often if clinically indicated).  
Any abnormal findings require adjustment, removal and reapplication of restraints 
if necessary.   
D. Restraint methods must allow the patient to straighten the abdomen and chest 
such that they can take full breaths. 
 
E. Under no circumstances are patients to be transported in the prone position 
regardless of who applies the restraint. 
 
F. EMS personnel must ensure that the patient's position allows for adequate 
monitoring of vital signs, does not compromise respiratory, circulatory, or 
neurological status, and does not preclude any necessary medical intervention to 
protect or manage the airway should vomiting occur. 
 
G. EMS restraints shall not be attached to movable side rails of a gurney. 
 
H. Restraint devices applied by LE require the officer's continued presence to 
ensure patient and scene management safety.   
 
1. The LE officer should accompany the patient in the ambulance. 
   
2. In the unusual event that this is not possible, the LE officer should follow 
by driving in tandem with the ambulance on a pre-determined route. 
 
3. A method to alert the LE officer of any problems that may develop during 
transport should be discussed prior to leaving the scene.   
 
4. If the patient is handcuffed by LE officers, consideration should be made 
to transition to the least restrictive restraints that are safe for the patient 
and responders, including consideration of transfer to EMS restraints. 
                         
III.   Pharmacologic Management of the Patient in Restraints 
 
A. A patient who has undergone physical restraint should not be allowed to continue 
to struggle against the restraints as this may lead to injury (i.e., rhabdomyolysis, 
strains, sprains, severe acidosis, cardiac ischemia).  
 
B. Patients who are agitated while in physical restraint may receive midazolam by 
EMS personnel to reduce agitation with continued monitoring for respiratory 
depression, in accordance with (TP 1209, Psychiatric/Behavioral Emergencies). 
 
1. If the patient remains agitated in BLS care and there is an ongoing 
concern for patient safety, ALS upgrade shall be initiated.  
 
2. Resuscitation and monitoring equipment, including oxygen and bag valve 
mask, should be near the patient and accessible prior to proceeding with 
sedation. 
 
3. Initiate monitoring of pulse oximetry, cardiac rhythm, and capnography 
(when available) as soon as possible peri-/post-sedation and prior to  

SUBJECT: APPLICATION OF PATIENT RESTRAINTS REFERENCE NO. 838

transport. Contact Base for guidance if persistent agitation prevents 
monitoring prior to transport. 
 
IV. Required Documentation on the Patient Care/EMS Report Form 
 
 A. Reason restraints were applied 
 
            B.        Type of restraints applied 
 
 C. Identity of agency/medical facility applying restraints 
 
D. Assessment of the overall cardiac and respiratory status of the patient; and the 
circulatory, motor and neurological status of the restrained extremities at a 
minimum of every 15 minutes 
 
            E. Reason for removing or reapplying the restraints or any abnormal findings 
 
V.  Quality Assurance:   
 
A. Develop a process for review of selected cases where physical restraint and/or 
medication are used by EMS personnel to manage agitation, with attention to the 
type of restraint(s) used, the quality and frequency of physiologic monitoring, 
protocol compliance, and documentation compliance.  
 
B. Agencies shall track the use of medications for the purpose of management of 
agitated patients.

1200 Table of Contents 
PURPOSE: To provide guidelines for the release of CHEMPACK to designated personnel 
during times of medical need. 
 
DEFINITION: 
 
CHEMPACK: The CHEMPACK program was created by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 
and designed to place nerve agent antidotes in communities all over the country to support a 
quick response to a nerve agent attack. The CHEMPACK program is a component of the 
Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). Each CHEMPACK contains auto-injector antidote kits, 
atropine, 2-Pralidoxime, sterile water for injection, and Diazepam/Midazolam. There are two 
types of CHEMPACK containers: 
 
• EMS CHEMPACK: Designed for prehospital medical providers, and the antidotes 
contained in the EMS CHEMPACK are mostly auto-injectors for speed and ease of use. 
 
• Hospital CHEMPACK: Designed for hospital medical staff, and the antidotes contained 
in the hospital CHEMPACK are primarily multi-dose vials. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency has fielded and 
maintains a current inventory of 65 CHEMPACK caches, that are geographically stored 
throughout the County.  
 
2. The EMS Agency coordinates quality assurance of all 65 CHEMPACKs per the 
Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) protocol and each site 
manager should provide routine reports to EMS. 
 
3. The overall authority to deploy CHEMPACKs, or portions of its contents, to the field or 
local hospitals rests with the EMS Agency. The EMS Agency will coordinate the 
deployment. 
 
4. In any event involving a terrorist attack employing chemical nerve agents, the EMS 
Agency, hospitals, and provider agencies shall implement their terrorism notification 
procedures and monitor the situation. 
 
5. CHEMPACK deployment shall be for incidents in which a nerve agent is responsible for 
the casualties. The incident must be a mass casualty incident which exceeds the 
provider agencies’ Disaster Pharmaceutical Caches (DPC), Ref. No. 1104, Disaster 
Pharmaceutical Caches Carried by Authorized ALS Providers, for patient use or hospital 
resources to deal with the patient load.  
 

SUBJECT: CHEMPACK DEPLOYMENT REFERENCE NO. 1108 
 FOR NERVE AGENT RELEASE 
  
 
 
 PAGE 437 OF 447 
 
6. CHEMPACKs may be pre-deployed for special events. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Types of Deployment 
 
A. Field Deployment - This scenario involves the deployment of CHEMPACK 
resources to an incident site in a public area. This would occur in the case of an 
overt nerve agent release in a populated area such as a stadium or inside a 
building. 
 
B. Hospital Deployment – This scenario may involve an overt or covert terrorist 
attack in which the first sign of an attack may be the unexplained surge of 
patients seeking treatment at local hospital(s) for symptoms indicating nerve 
agent exposure. 
 
II. Role of the Provider Agency 
 
A. Determine whether first responder DPCs for patient use are sufficient to handle 
the incident. If provider agency’s DPC resources are adequate to deal with the 
patient load, generally no other pharmaceutical assistance would be requested. 
 
B. Notify the EMS Agency via the Medical Alert Center (MAC) by either telephone at 
(562) 378-1789, ReddiNet, or VMED28 Radio:155.34mhz. If unable to contact 
the MAC, EMS personnel shall contact the Fire Operational Area Coordinator 
(FOAC) – Los Angeles County Fire District (which is contacted through its 
dispatch center). 
 
C. If DPC resources are inadequate, request the deployment of an EMS 
CHEMPACK via the MAC. Provide the MAC with the following information: 
 
1. Incident location; 
 
2. Chemical agent (if known); 
 
3. Number and severity of victims; and 
 
4. Chief complaints of patients. 
 
D. Transport the EMS CHEMPACK from the CHEMPACK storage site to the scene. 
 
III. Role of the affected hospital(s) 
 
A. Determine whether the hospital’s resources are adequate to deal with the patient 
load. If the hospital’s resources are adequate to deal with the patient load, 
generally no other pharmaceutical assistance would be requested. 
 
B. Notify the EMS Agency via the MAC at (562) 378-1789 or ReddiNet of a possible 
terrorist attack. The hospital shall provide the MAC with the following information: 
 

SUBJECT: CHEMPACK DEPLOYMENT REFERENCE NO. 1108 
 FOR NERVE AGENT RELEASE 
  
 
 
 PAGE 438 OF 447 
 
1. Name of hospital; 
 
2. Point of Contact (POC); 
 
3. Best contact information; 
 
4. Chemical agent (if known); 
 
5. Number and severity of victims; and 
 
6. Chief complaints of patients. 
 
C. If hospital resources are inadequate, request deployment of the hospital 
CHEMPACK from the EMS Agency. 
 
D. Transport the hospital CHEMPACK from the CHEMPACK storage site to the 
hospital. 
 
IV. Role of the EMS Agency 
 
A. Once contacted by provider agency or affected hospital, contact the closest 
CHEMPACK storage site to the incident and instruct the storage site staff to 
prepare the appropriate CHEMPACK for deployment. 
 
B. Contact the CHEMPACK storage site and request POC information and pick-up 
location at storage site. 
 
C. Provide the affected hospital or provider agency with the POC and pick-up 
location at CHEMPACK storage site. 
 
V. Role of the CHEMPACK storage sites 
 
A. Maintain a deployment plan that contains a minimum of the following information:  
 
1. CHEMPACK deployment training for staff; 
 
2. 24/7/365 POC list;  
 
3. CHEMPACK storage location; 
 
4. Instructions on how to access location and key; and 
 
5. Location of preferred pick-up point. 
 
B. When notified by the EMS Agency to deploy, prepare the CHEMPACK as per 
deployment plan.
