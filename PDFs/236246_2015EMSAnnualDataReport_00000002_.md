# 236246 2015EMSAnnualDataReport 00000002

We are happy to present the 2015 
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Sys-
tem Data Report.   
This report is in-
tended to educate 
participants and 
the public on the 
performance of 
the EMS System.  
The Board of Supervi-
sors, Department of 
Health Services leadership, fire depart-
ments, ambulance companies and hos-
pitals have been instrumental in mak-
ing improvements to our methods of 
data collection.  All EMS Agency data 
originates from 9-1-1 patient care re-
ports and self reported hospital data. 
We are now able to track patients from 
the prehospital setting to their discharge 
from our established specialty care centers 
to analyze system performance and insti-
tute appropriate policy changes for the pre-
hospital patient. 
This is the first year that we are able to map 
our data by Service Planning Areas (SPA).  
This is important to align with other County 
health programs. 
As we move into 2016, 
we are looking forward to 
being able to run timely 
and more detailed re-
ports for our providers 
and the public to answer 
system questions and 
make policy decisions 
supported by data and 
science.

EMS SYSTEM REPORT 
Trauma Mortality 
Adjusted for each Service Planning Area (SPA) with all other SPAs  as reference 
Overall mortality rate is 3.8% which is less than the current national average as reported by the 
American College of Surgeons.  Using the TRISS model to calculate the percent of actual deaths 
compared to expected death, the Los Angeles County Trauma System scored 81.4% (95% CI 79.8-
82.9%) indicating the system has almost 20% fewer deaths than expected. 
TRISS Odd Ratio for 
Death (99.3% CI) 
TRISS (Trauma Score-Injury Severity Score) risk-adjusted model determines the probability of survival of a patient from the 
Injury Severity Score and the Revised Trauma Score. 
Haider risk-adjusted model is based on analysis of 2009-10 National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) which takes into 
consideration age, hypotension, pulse, Glasgow Coma Score, Injury Severity Score, and need for ventilator use.
