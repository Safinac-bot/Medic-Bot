Classification 
 Electrolyte / Alkalinizing Agent 
 
LA County Prehospital Indications  
Cardiac Arrest – Non-Traumatic: suspected hyperkalemia, patients with renal failure 
Cardiac Dysrhythmia: suspected hyperkalemia causing bradycardia  
Overdose / Poisoning / Ingestion: suspected tricyclic overdose with ECG changes 
Traumatic Injury: suspected hyperkalemia in the setting of crush injury or potential for development of crush 
syndrome (administer prior to release of crushed tissue) 
 
Other Common Indications (Not authorized for EMS administration in LA County) 
None 
 
Adult Dose 
50mEq (50mL) slow IV/IO push

Can reduce potency of epinephrine, flush line after administration.

Tissue damage if IV infiltrates
