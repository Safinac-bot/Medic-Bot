ANNUAL EMS PLAN UPDATE 
(Fiscal Year 2020-2021) 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.254, requires the Emergency Medical 
Services (EMS) Agency to submit an EMS Plan to the State EMS Authority and follow it with 
annual updates thereafter.  Attached is the Los Angeles County Fiscal Year (FY) 2020-2021 
Annual Update which provides the required information on the status of our system and the 
EMS Agency's progress toward meeting long-range goals. 
 
Communications: 
 
The EMS Agency continues to be an active participant and voting member of the governing 
body of the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS) Board of 
Directors.  LA-RICS’ mission is to provide the finest mission-critical communication system with 
unwavering focus on the needs of the public safety professional. It is being designed and built 
to serve law enforcement and fire service first responders, along with health service 
professionals throughout Los Angeles County. 
 
With over 80 public safety agencies with approximately 34,000 first-responders and 
encompassing a sprawling terrain of over 4,060 square miles that approximately 10 million 
people call home, the Los Angeles region seeks a modern interoperable public safety 
broadband network that allows multiple agencies to respond to the widest possible variety of 
emergencies. LA-RICS has transferred operation and ownership of its 700MHz broadband 
network to ATT/First-Net, which is based on 4G/5G wireless data technology. The network 
would enable computer-aided dispatch, rapid law-enforcement queries, real-time video 
streaming, medical telemetry, patient tracking, geographic information systems services for 
first responders, and many other broadband-specific applications. 
LA-RICS is partnered with AT&T/First-Net, a nationwide first responder network authority to 
ensure coordination with the broadband network on a national level for public safety and first 
responders. 
 
EMS System Data Report: 
 
Efforts to incorporate the STEMI and stroke databases into a combined database with the three 
(3) core EMS Agency databases (EMS, Base Hospital, and Trauma Center) continue.   To 
further enhance reporting and access capability, the EMS Agency continues to explore 
opportunities to improve TEMIS, such as a web-based solution. 
 
Of the ~700,000 EMS responses in the County, 100% of patient care records from public 
EMS providers are now collected through an electronic patient care report (ePCR).   
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Executive Summary 
Page 2 of 4 
 
NEMSIS Compliance (100% of system data for the end of reporting period FY 2020-2021): 
 
Los Angeles County Fire District – (46% of system data) utilize ImageTrend. 
City of Los Angeles Fire Department – (31% of system data) utilize Stryker. 
Cities of Torrance and Redondo Beach Fire Department’s (2% of system data) – utilize 
W.A.T.E.R. 
Remaining 25 Fire Departments (21% of system data) utilize   Digital EMS. Digital EMS 
became compliant for NEMSIS 3.5 to both collect and send data on April 28, 2021. 
 
During FY 2020-2021, the EMS Agency submitted 100% records to CEMSIS-Trauma; 
however, did not export EMS related data to CEMSIS.   
 
Sidewalk CPR: 
 
The EMS Agency Sidewalk CPR is an annual program that traditionally provides in-person 
“hands-only” CPR training throughout Los Angeles County during National CPR & AED 
Awareness Week (June1-7). The Sidewalk CPR program was suspended in 2020 due to 
COVID-19.  
 
Early 2021, the EMS Agency produced and published an instructional hands-only CPR video 
with techniques for reducing COVID transmission https://youtu.be/jHaicno95sk
. This training 
video is posted on our website and shared with community partners to allow for a broader 
distribution. Our goal is to continue improving bystander CPR response during the pandemic. 
The views can be tracked when viewed on YouTube.

of emergency medical 
transport vehicles, non-
transporting advanced life 
support responders, and 
acute care facilities and shall

EMS agency's communication 
plan should consider the 
availability and use of 
satellites and cellular 
telephones. 
 
X   CURRENT STATUS:   
21 Base Stations and 49 
paramedic provider agencies, 
which account for the 678 dual-
paramedic public provider units, 
who have access to 9 medical 
channels.  Medical channels are 
assigned to the hospital base 
station.  Communication 
assignments have been developed 
and implemented.  Hospital base 
stations are assigned a primary 
channel and, in most cases, a 
backup frequency. 
 
LEMSA communication standards 
require 90% coverage, 90% of the 
time.  The standard is maintained 
by the installation of local base 
stations at the hospital site and 
remote base stations at 
strategically placed sites to 
overcome communication 
problems caused by terrain.  
LEMSA has installed and 
maintains 11 remote base stations 
on the mainland and 3 remote 
base stations on Catalina Island.

facilities. ReddiNet is also utilized 
at    the Operations Control Division 
for Los Angeles City Fire 
Department, allowing access to all 
of their ALS field units. 
 
The County Wide Integrated Radio 
System (CWIRS) is installed at all 
Los Angeles County hospitals, 
comprehensive health centers, and 
ambulatory care centers.  
Cellular telephone communication 
and radio are the primary 
communications tools utilized by 
field personnel to make base 
station contact.

We  are  dedicating  this  issue  of  the  EMS  Sys-
tem  Report  to  Michelle  Williams,  Chief,  Data 
Systems     Management     for     our     agency.  
Michelle  has  worked  with  the  EMS  Agency  for 
the  past  9  years.    She  has  served  as  the  lead 
of our Data  Management  Section since 2018.   
Michelle   has   been   in-
strumental    in    moving 
the   EMS   Agency   and 
our system to electronic 
data   collection,   ensur-
ing    data    quality    and 
consistency,   and   edu-
cating     our     providers 
and   hospitals   on   the 
importance    of    quality 
data  to  direct  our  sys-
tem and patient care. 
 
Michelle    worked    tirelessly,    starting    from 
scratch, to evolve our system from a  predomi-
nantly  pen  and  paper  system  to  the  100% 
electronic  system  we  have  today.    She  has 
worked  with  each  provider  agency,  hospital 
and digital system to convert LA County over to 
an  entirely  new  platform.    Her  understanding 
of data management has enabled us to utilize 
this critical information to make vital decisions 
and   conduct   quality   improvement   and   re-
search on behalf of the over 10 million people 
who  live  in  and  visit  our  county.    She  dedicated 
countless hours this past year collecting and veri-
fying COVID hospital assessment  data  which  was 
critical to the county’s understanding of the pan-
demic and provided support to policy decisions. 
 
Michelle has recently left our EMS Agency to pur-
sue  personal  goals.    Her  talent  and  drive  will  be 
sorely  missed.    I  hope  you  will  join  us  in  wishing 
Michelle  the   best   in   her   new   endeavors   and 
thanking  her  for  instilling  excellence  in  our  EMS 
program and systems.  
 
This  last  year  has  been  a  challenging  one  for  all 
of  EMS.  As  the  pandemic  wanes  we  honor  all 
those  who  participated  in 
the  response  locally  and 
regionally.  Data  played  a 
critical role in the manage-
ment of the pandemic and 
allowed   for   opportunities 
for  the  system  to  predict 
surge.   Thanks   to   all   for 
their  dedication  in  caring 
for   our   EMS   community 
this last year.

Critical—a patient presents an acute injury or illness that could result in permanent damage, injury or death (head injury, vehicular accident, shooting). Applicable  
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for this level of service would be 99284 (detailed history, detailed physical, and medical decision making of moderate 
complexity) or 99285 (medical decision making of high complexity) or 99291 (critical care, evaluation and management). 
Urgent—a  patient  with an acute injury or illness, loss of life or limb is not an immediate threat to their well-being, or a patient who needs timely evaluation (fracture or 
laceration). Applicable CPT codes for this level of service would be 99282 (medical decision making of low complexity) or 99283 (medical decision making of moderate 
complexity). 
Non-Urgent—a patient with a non-emergent injury, illness or condition; sometimes chronic; that can be treated in a non-emergency setting and not necessarily on the 
same day they are seen in the ED (pregnancy tests, toothache, minor cold, ingrown toenail). An applicable CPT code for this level of service would be 99281 (straight 
forward medical decision making).

Los Angeles County EMS Agency Mission Statement 
 
 
 
 
The Los Angeles County (LAC) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency is 
responsible for monitoring and implementing regulatory oversight over for one of the 
largest multijurisdictional EMS systems in the nation. The LAC system utilizes more 
than 18,000 certified EMS personnel employed by public and private organizations, 
fire departments, ambulance companies, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies to 
provide emergency and non-emergency prehospital care to over 10 million residents 
and visitors. 
 
LAC requires a comprehensive quality improvement (QI) program to provide ongoing 
system evaluation to maintain quality in day-to-day operations while implementing 
process improvement strategies to advance patient care delivery that are consistent 
with best practices and evidence-based medicine. The QI plan provides the written 
framework for the QI program. 
 
Our system utilizes a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to drive improvement. 
It is educational, not punitive by design to encourage the exchange of information to 
enhance patient safety and minimize adverse events. Quality patient care delivery is 
sustained through ongoing evaluation, timely system feedback and education, in 
addition to, providing opportunities to acknowledge performance excellence within 
the system. 
 
The EMS Agency and QI program supports the California EMS Authority (EMSA) in 
the development, implementation, and reporting of statewide Core Measures. 
 
The LAC EMS QI plan is written in accordance with the California Code of Regulations, 
Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 12: Emergency Medical Services System Quality 
Improvement and is consistent with the State of California Emergency Medical 
Services System Quality Improvement Program Model Guidelines and EMSA 166, 
Appendix E, EMS Core Quality Measures. 
 
To advance the health of our communities by ensuring 
quality emergency and disaster medical services

III. Data Management 
A. Data Collection 
The EMS Agency obtains information through a variety of methods that include 
the following sources: electronic data exchange, hard copy review, internal and 
external customer surveys, and program reviews (audits). Data collection is 
primarily conducted via the Trauma and Emergency Medicine Information 
System (TEMIS), Lancet Technology Innovative Data Solutions by ESO. The 
TEMIS database assists the EMS Agency in evaluating, monitoring, and 
coordinating all EMS system components, as well as meet state data collection 
requirements. 
All public 9-1-1 and Exclusive Operating Area provider agencies utilize an 
electronic patient care record (ePCR) platform. Private (non-9-1-1) provider 
agencies, paramedic base hospitals and trauma centers utilizing paper PCR 
capture the required data elements using an approved electronic platform and 
standard paper forms (EMS Report Form, Base Hospital Form and Trauma 
Patient Summary Form). All paramedic base hospitals and trauma centers 
conduct data entry on site. The data is uploaded automatically to a dedicated 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site every 24 hours.    
Other mechanisms by which the EMS Agency obtains data include, direct data 
input to the LA STEMI and LA Stroke databases by the designated SRC and 
stroke hospitals. Stroke data is also downloaded from the Get With The 
Guidelines (GWTG) Patient Management Tool. Helicopter EMS (HEMS) data is 
submitted to the EMS Agency on a quarterly basis from the three HEMS 
providers in LA County. The EMS Agency continues to work on the process of 
incorporating the STEMI, Stroke and HEMS data into TEMIS. Systemwide data 
collection on hospital diversion, bed availability, and surge capacity are 
collected via ReddiNet. 

Los Angeles County 
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2020/21 Quality Improvement Plan 
 
Table 13 QI Plan  Page 8 of 17 
 
 
 
The Public Safety Agency Data Registry allows public safety agencies approved 
for naloxone administration to enter data directly into the data registry. Each 
public safety agency may utilize the data registry to generate reports on their 
own agency to assist in the quality improvement process required 
for program approval. The EMS Agency oversees the data and is 
able to  provide aggregate system reports. 
 
 
B. Data Validation 
Data submitted to the EMS Agency databases undergoes an extensive data 
quality review and clean up through the following mechanisms: 
 
1.  EMS Agency data entry personnel conduct monthly peer review data 
audits. Identified errors are corrected and overall data entry performance 
is included in the data entry personnel’s periodic performance evaluation 
report. 
 
2.  EMS provider agencies utilizing electronic data collection are required to 
validate their data using the EMS Agency’s published EMS Data 
Validator before submission to the FTP site. The EMS Agency conducts 
a secondary validation before final upload to TEMIS. Data that fails 
validation is rejected and sent back to the EMS Provider for correction. 
 
3.  Annual data audits are conducted by the EMS Agency for each EMS 
Provider Agency. A corrective action plan is required for data elements 
that fall below a 90% compliance rate for accuracy and completeness. 
 
4.  Data clean up reports are generated by the EMS Agency on a quarterly 
basis for Paramedic Base Hospitals and Trauma Centers. In general, a 
corrective action plan is required for data elements that fall below a 90% 
compliance rate for accuracy and completeness. 
 
5.  Documentation reports are routinely developed and disseminated in the 
quality improvement committees for evaluation and education on the 
application of the data dictionary and data standards to improve 
reliability. 
C. Data Submission 
1.  The EMS Agency ensures timely data collection and submission from 
base and trauma hospitals through written agreements. 
2.  Data collection requirements for other specialty care centers are 
prescribed in the specific specialty care center standards and local 
policies. 

Los Angeles County 
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2020/21 Quality Improvement Plan 
 
Table 13 QI Plan  Page 9 of 17 
 
3.  EMS provider agency data collection requirements are governed by local 
policies. Submission of required data to the EMS Agency is highly 
dependent upon organizational resources (method of data collection/
 
ePCR vendor) and size (personnel/volume of EMS responses). The EMS 
Agency has established policies and procedures specific to submission of 
electronic patient care data. However, provider agencies can experience 
vendor-related problems that cause significant delays in data submission 
to the EMS Agency. The EMS Agency and EMS community continue to 
work together on improving data collection and submission as the system 
transitions to the CEMSIS data requirements. 
4.  The LA County Trauma Center Programs participate in the American 
College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) and 
are members of the LA County TQIP Collaborative. Collaborative system- 
level TQIP reports allow us to compare our system performance to 
national results and impart opportunities for systemwide QI projects. 
 
5.  EMS providers may be required to submit self-reported data utilizing 
Excel spreadsheets for the following reasons: 
a.  Non-911 (interfacility) transports are not entered into TEMIS. 
 
b.  Base hospitals and public 911 provider agencies may be required 
to submit data on prospective QI projects when the required data 
cannot be accessed through the EMS Agency databases. 
 
c.   Provider agencies approved for a pilot project with an expanded 
local scope of practice requiring data not captured in the EMS 
Agency databases. 
 
d.  The EMS Agency joined the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance 
Survival (CARES) with data entry into CARES database 
beginning January 2021 for system benchmarking. 
 
D. Data Utilization 
1.  The EMS Agency utilizes the TEMIS, LA STEMI, LA Stroke, and GWTG 
databases for both statewide core measures and local system reports. 
The local reports are utilized for daily operations such as performance 
and contract monitoring, system audits, policy revision, and QI activities. 
The databases are also used to provide the information needed to 
analyze the potential impact of hospital diversions and closures. 
2.  Self-reported data utilizing Excel spreadsheets are utilized, when needed 
for private non-9-1-1 provider agency QI projects and evaluating 
performance and ensuring patient safety when new medications, 
treatment and/or devices are implemented in the system. 

Los Angeles County 
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2020/21 Quality Improvement Plan 
 
Table 13 QI Plan  Page 10 of 17 
 
3.  Public Safety Data Registry was implemented in May 2020 and will 
initially be utilized to evaluate the utilization of naloxone administered by 
approved public safety agencies. The plan is to expand the data registry 
to collect additional data regarding other field care provided by public 
safety agencies (i.e., tourniquet application and AED). 
 
E. Limitations 
1.  Separate Databases: t he existence of multiple databases is not ideal 
for timely reporting. Multiple data entry and data abstraction are 
conducted on the same patient. Data analysis is resource-intensive 
when data elements are found in the various databases. 
2.  Multiple System Participants: data validation and transmission are 
complex as more EMS provider agencies move toward utilizing various 
ePCR software applications. Changes to the reporting standards often 
require additional time and expense. 
3.  Data Quality: current methods of data capture require extensive data 
audits. Cleanup is needed to ensure valid and reliable data. 
 
4.  Data Use Agreement (DUA): meaningful evaluation of system 
performance is highly dependent on the collaboration amongst the 
participants, consensus on how data will be collected and utilized. 
Currently, the EMS Agency is only able to share a limited dataset with the 
EMS Authority without a DUA in place. A DUA would allow for an open 
and full exchange of data that can be used to expand the evaluation of 
system performance and improve delivery of care. 
 
IV. Quality Measures 
A. Utilization of Provider Impression/New Treatment Protocols 
The revised adult and pediatric Treatment Protocols (TP) utilizing Provider 
Impression (PI) codes were implemented in 2018 with systemwide transition 
complete in April 2019. The EMS Public 9-1-1 Provider Agency and Base Hospital 
QI Committee assist the EMS Agency in evaluating the transition. Reference 1373, 
Medical Control Guideline: 
Medical Control Guideline: Treatment Protocol Quality 
Improvement Fallout Data Dictionary  is a    comprehensive tool developed to assist with 
standardizing the QI process.  In March 2020 the systemwide QI moved from 
evaluating the new TPs to COVID-19 related Provider Impressions of concern and 
introduced 
Treatment Protocol: Reference No. 1245, Potential COVID-19 Patients  
to serve as a guidance for treatment.  
  
 Ambulance Patient Offload Time (APOT) 
The EMS Agency continues to work with the system participants to collect data 
using the Standardize Methods for Collecting and Reporting APOT data adopted by 
the EMS Authority. A workgroup has been convened to assist the EMS Agency in 
policy development to provide guidance in reducing 911 patient offload time. 
Members include representatives from the following organizations: Hospital 
Association of Southern California, Los Angeles County Ambulance Association,  

Los Angeles County 
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2020/21 Quality Improvement Plan 
 
Table 13 QI Plan  Page 11 of 17 
 
Emergency Nurses Association, Los Angeles County Professional Fire Fighter’s 
union, public (9-1-1) and private (non-911) provider agencies, and base hospitals. 
Private non-911 provider agencies who routinely transport to the emergency 
department and in-patient hospital collect and self-report APOT data to the EMS 
Agency for tracking and trending purposes.  
 
B. EMSA Core Quality Measures 
The EMS Agency historically has participated in statewide data submission to 
CEMSIS and continues to actively participate in statewide data collection through 
the submission of core measure data outlined in EMSA #166, EMS Quality 
Improvement Program Guidelines/Core Quality Measures. To ensure reliable and 
valid data, the EMS Agency will continue to update our data dictionary and provide 
training/feedback to EMS personnel on documentation of the core measure data 
elements with the exception of ambulance response times by zones. The LAC EMS 
system is not designed to collect data by zones
. Alternatively, systemwide 
ambulance response times are collected and reported. 
 
C. COVID-19 
The EMS Agency implemented 
Reference No. 845, Treat and Refer for Mild 
Respiratory Illness During the COVID-19 Outbreak t  o provide additional guidance 
to Reference 1245 regarding treatment in place and transport decisions during the 
pandemic. A   dedicated webpage was established to enable timely access to 
current information on COVID-19 related hospital and prehospital data, PPE and 
educational resources. Furthermore, the EMS Agency implemented weekly Zoom 
conference calls led by the Medical Director to provide the EMS community with 
information and updates on clinical and operational aspects that impact the delivery 
of prehospital care.  
 
D. Pediatric Readiness Project –   LA Peds Ready 
The National Pediatric Readiness Project (NPRP) is a multi-phase quality improvement 
initiative to ensure all emergency departments have the essential resources in place to 
provide effective emergency care to sick and injured children. The NPRP is partnership 
with the federal EMS for Children program, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the 
American College of Emergency Physicians, and Emergency Nurses Association. 
LA Peds Ready was developed to assist the Los Angeles County emergency 
departments with access to the NPRP assessment tools, resources, and on-line 
educational activities designed to improve delivery of pediatric emergency care. 
Participation in the NPRP assessment has been added to the EDAP standards. The 
2020 national assessment was postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic.

VI. Evaluation of System Indicators 
A. The System EMS QI Coordinator and designated staff prepare reports on 
system performance indicators to be utilized by the QI Team, Advisory 
Committees, and EMS Commission to ensure systemwide evaluation. 
 
B. Under the direction of the EMS Agency Medical Director, the EMS Agency QI 
Team will analyze system reports generated by each EMS Agency section 
responsible for reporting on current performance indicators and EMS Authority 
Core Measures. 
 
C. Presentations on performance indicators will be prepared in the most 
appropriate format to allow for ease of interpretation of data. Formats most 
commonly utilized include line charts, bar graphs, flowcharts, and data tables. 
 
VII. Action to Improve 
 
A.   The EMS Agency, under the direction of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, utilizes the FOCUS PDSA model for performance improvement. 
 
1. Find a    process to improve; improvement needs are identified by the EMS 
Agency QI Team in collaboration with the TAG, QI and Advisory groups. 
2. Organize the process utilizing the team most familiar with the process related to 
the system process identified. 
3. Clarify current knowledge of the process by collecting information and reviewing 
current trends. 
4. Under
stand capabilities and causes for variations in processes by utilizing 
brainstorming techniques and fishbone diagrams or flowcharts. 
5. Select a strategy or process for improvement that will most likely reduce or 
eliminate the causes for variation in performance. 
6. Plan, determine objectives and develop plan in agreement with system 
participants. 

Los Angeles County 
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2020/21 Quality Improvement Plan 
 
Table 13 QI Plan  Page 15 of 17 
 
7. Do, carry out the action according to established plan. 
8. Study findings, the EMS QI Team with system input will analyze the findings, 
compare with hypothesis, and prepare a summary for a trend report. 
9. Act on findings, the EMS QI Team in collaboration with the QI and Advisory 
groups will determine performance improvement needs. A quality    task 
force may be chartered if needed, to carry out specific performance 
improvement plans. 
 
VIII. Training and Education 
 
A. The effectiveness of the QI process is related to the efficacy of training and 
educational activities. Due the size and complexity of our system, training and 
education is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms: 
1. Quality Improvement Committees/Advisory Meetings 
Information needed for improving local system and statewide 
performance is disseminated to committee members for training and 
education of providers responsible for direct patient care. 
 
2. EMS Update 
Under the direction of Dr. Denise Whitfield, designated EMS Agency 
staff, Paramedic Training Institute, and system stakeholders develop and 
implement the mandatory annual EMS Update that address educational 
and training needs related to system need and performance 
improvement. The EMS Update 2020 format was changed to an on-line 
format utilizing a learning management system for ease of access and 
tracking compliance.  
3. EMS System Data Report 
The EMS Agency publishes an Los Angeles County EMS System 
Report t  hat provides valuable feedback to the EMS community and 
citizens of Los Angeles on demographics and performance.  
 
4.  
The Emergi-Press
 is a web-based EMS educational forum located on the 
EMS Agency website. Educational material includes, ECG of the month 
video learning modules, and cases from the field that are posted monthly 
with availability to earn continuing education credit. Additionally, the 
Emergi-Press utilizes Updates from The Medical Director to communicate 
pertinent information to EMS personnel and stakeholders regarding 
system issues.  
 
B. The EMS Agency QI Team and other advisory groups review policies and 
procedures to insure consistency with the EMSA and LAC EMS QI plan. 
C. Once a performance improvement plan has been successfully implemented, the 
EMS Agency will post all policies and system updates to its website to allow 
timely access by all EMS participants.

VIII. Update/Summary 
The QI plan is updated to reflect the changes in our plan and performance measures. 
Year 2020 required the EMS Agency to focus efforts on evaluating COVID-  19 related 
Provider Impressions, utilization of Treatment Protocol Reference 1245, Potential 
COVID-19 Patient, Reference 834, Patient Refusal of Treatment or Transport, and 
Reference 845, Treat and Refer for Mild Respiratory Illness During the COVID-19 
Outbreak. An ad hoc committee with community partners was convened  to    evaluate 
the EMS Agency data and improve prehospital care for patients not transported. The 
QI plan is submitted to EMSA for review and published on the EMS Agency website for 
review by the EMS participants and system stakeholders.
