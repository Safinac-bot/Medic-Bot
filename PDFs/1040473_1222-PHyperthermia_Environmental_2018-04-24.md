SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Cooling measures should include moving patient to a cooler environment (e.g. ambulance with air 
conditioner), removing clothing, applying wet towels, and fanning/blowing cool air from air 
conditioning vents. If shivering occurs, stop and cover with a dry blanket. 
 
❷   Children left in vehicles are at significant risk of hyperthermia even with normal external ambient 
temperatures, because of the greenhouse effect. Entrapped children should be immediately 
extricated; this may require breaking the window.  
 
❸ This protocol is intended for hyperthermia due to environmental exposures and toxic ingestions.
