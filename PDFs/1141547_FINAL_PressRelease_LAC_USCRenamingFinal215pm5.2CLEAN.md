INTRODUCING LOS ANGELES GENERAL MEDICAL CENTER: 
LAC+USC MEDICAL CENTER UNVEILS NEW NAME AND BRAND 
  
       Largest Public Hospital West of Texas Promotes Expansion of Innovative ‘Safer at Home’ 
Program to Treat as Many Patients as Possible Across a Wide Range of Health Needs, Charting the 
Future of Health  
 
LA County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis, Mayor Karen Bass, and Special Guests  
Join Medical Center Leadership to Celebrate the Facility’s Past, Present, and Future 
  
Los Angeles, CA — Today, Los Angeles County Medical Center (LAC+USC) leadership and Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Hilda L. Solis will be joined by Mayor Karen Bass to announce that the 
County’s largest health care facility will now be known as Los Angeles General Medical Center (LA 
General). Members of LA General leadership and staff will gather alongside community supporters to 
unveil the new name while celebrating the facility’s history and looking ahead to its future. 
  
The unveiling of a new name for the historic facility marks an extraordinary milestone for the entire 
community of Los Angeles. Just a few miles east of Downtown Los Angeles in the Boyle Heights 
neighborhood, the medical center dates to 1878 and serves thousands of residents across Los Angeles 
County. The facility’s new name and brand reflect an active and intentional commitment to strengthen the 
trust between the medical center and the community of Los Angeles and to continue to expand its role as 
a partner in building healthy, full, and long lives within the communities it serves. 
  
Currently, Los Angeles General Medical Center provides world-class care across a broad range of 
specialties, in addition to providing trauma care and primary care. Its modern facilities include a Level-
One trauma center, a training site for the U.S. Navy, and it is one of the nation’s premier teaching 
hospitals. The medical center campus is also home to a nonprofit organization, The Wellness Center, 
which provides a range of programs for community residents. 
  
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the facility pioneered its award-winning ‘Safer at Home’ initiative, 
providing COVID-infected Angelenos with resources to fully and safely recover at home. This was a 
critical program for the most populous county in the nation to meet the ever-increasing need for care 
during the pandemic. LA General Medical Center’s COVID-19 Safer at Home program won the 
prestigious Gage Award from America’s Essential Hospitals for healthcare innovation; the program was 
also was adopted by the World Health Organization during the oxygen crisis in India in 2021. The 

 
 
program has successfully cared for more than 4,000 COVID-19 patients at home, on oxygen, with 
excellent patient outcomes and high patient satisfaction. It was so successful that it was expanded beyond 
COVID-19 in 2022 for patients with other selected diagnoses. 
  
Now, this program is officially expanding to serve patients with a wide array of health needs, including 
patients with skin or bone infections, kidney infections, bacterial pneumonia, exacerbations of COPD or 
asthma, and Congestive Heart Failure. Patients with these and other conditions who would have otherwise 
been hospitalized and away from their families are now being sent home with concierge-level, 
protocolized care, as well as pulse oximeters and other medical equipment to allow remote monitoring of 
their conditions. Follow-up includes daily calls, remote vital sign monitoring, and focused return visits. In 
the first eight months, 556 patients with 37 different diagnoses have been cared for at home instead of the 
hospital, saving nearly 1,742 bed-days, enough to admit 316 other patients. 
 
Through this first-of-its-kind program, LA General is providing world-class care to patients who need it 
most, as well as resources that directly address factors impacting access to care. In addition to cutting-
edge medical technology, patients are often sent home with cell phones to bridge the digital divide so they 
can easily connect with their care team. LA General is charting the future of what health care looks like, 
providing world-class care to all regardless of income or background. 
  
Los Angeles General Medical Center will continue its affiliation with Keck School of Medicine of USC 
for graduate medical education, training interns and residents who are the county’s next generation of 
physicians. 
  
The medical center’s new name is followed by its new motto, “Exceptional Care. Healthy Communities.” 
The new motto summarizes the medical center’s mission to build healthy communities by being a trusted 
provider of excellent, whole-person care to all.
