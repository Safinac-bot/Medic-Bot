Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services 
Honored With 11 National Awards
 
The National Association of Counties recognized Health Services for best practices
and innovation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
JUNE 24, 2021 – Los Angeles, CA - The National Association of Counties Achievement Awards has
recognized Los Angeles County Department of Health Services with 11 national awards. The
awards highlight the department’s work in providing innovative services to LA County residents
during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Every year Los Angeles County submits groundbreaking programs from multiple agencies for
consideration by the National Association of Counties Achievement Awards. The winning programs
from Health Services include promoting health equity in COVID-19 testing for communities
disproportionally affected by the pandemic and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center’s Employee Child
Care Center established through an emergency waiver shortly after the shutdown so hospital staff
could continue to focus on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“2020 into 2021 was the hardest year we as health care professionals have ever faced in our
careers,” said Dr. Christina Ghaly, Director of Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.
“The doctors, nurses, and staff within Health Services rose to the occasion and kept our community
as safe and healthy as possible despite the odds. I am beyond proud of our teams and their
dedication to our community throughout the pandemic by creating innovative and life-saving
programs. We are humbled and honored by this national recognition.” 
The awards received by the Department of Health Services are:
 

• Preoperative Visits During Covid: Conversion of preoperative clinic visits to phone
visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anesthesiology Preoperative Clinic made a
transition from 100% in-person visits prior to the pandemic, to 99.7% telephonic visits
during the pandemic without a decrease in quality of care. 
• Fast Track Patient Recovery: Implementing a fast-track program to optimize medical
care, improve patient satisfaction and reduce healthcare costs. The cost-effective
program helps improve efficiency, decrease the amount of duplicate charting and
allows patients to be discharged faster.
• Laboratories Confront a Pandemic: County Department of Health Services
laboratories confront a pandemic. Labs leveraged recently implemented lab
optimization practices to on board several testing platforms, significantly improving
patient care by reducing turnaround times from a high of 9 days to less than 4 hours
for inpatients and 24 hours for the majority of outpatients. Providing an estimated
savings of over $2 million.
• Transporting Critically Ill Patient: Olive View’s Critical Care Transportation team is
making every minute count by successfully reducing transport preparation time from
activation to departure from 1-20 hours to just 33.2 minutes.
 
• Relieving the Burn: At Olive View Medical Center, pharmacists improve the use of
antibiotics in the emergency department for urinary tract infections. Through this
program Pharmacists were able to follow-up about 1 day faster and patients took
shorter courses of antibiotics, saving patients 64 days of antibiotics over a 2-month
time frame.
• Mental Health for Inmates: A model for jail diversion for individuals with severe
mental illness. Over 400 individuals have been diverted from the Los Angeles County
jails to Olive View Medical Center, where they have received state-of-the-art
psychiatric interventions and transitioned to continuing treatment, rehabilitation and
community housing services.
• Child Care in the Time Covid: Harbor-UCLA Medical Center’s response to support
staff and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 16, 2020, Harbor
opened an Employee Child Care center providing programs and supervision to the
children of hospital staff, allowing frontline heroes to focus on providing critical care to
patients. 

• Staff Deployment During Pandemic: Nursing specialty skills survey and dashboard.
The creation of this database and the ensuing modules proved very valuable during
the pandemic surge in the winter 2020-2021. Despite the varying shifts/schedules,
weekends and holidays, the database allowed DHS to align staff with available skills
with the unit or the patients that needed specific care.
• COVID-19 Testing Where Needed Most: Promoting health and racial equity in
COVID-19 testing for communities disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
pandemic in Los Angeles County. In a collaboration with multi-disciplinary partners
including DPH, faith-based and community-based partners, DHS used data on case
rates and COVID-19 percent positivity to place test sites within the highest risk
communities, and funded community and faith-based organizations to provide
outreach, engagement, and system navigation services.
• Pharmacy Medical Interventions: Transition of Care Pharmacy program, delivered a
high-value pharmacy intervention to vulnerable patients during the hospital-to-home
transition period when medication-related problems are common and can result in
safety complications and readmissions. Through the pandemic, workflows were
adapted to serve patients telephonically.
• Vaccinations During Covid: Walk-up and drive-through vaccination clinics for adults
and children. In 2020, with limited ability to vaccinate during routine, in-person doctor
appointments, a new approach was needed to confront the flu season. DHS Primary
Care created forty-four (44) new pop-up immunization clinics, located throughout Los
Angeles County. Influenza vaccination rates for September and October 2020 (9.7%,
20.1%) actually exceeded rates for the same months in 2019 (7.8%, 18.9%).                     
                                                                 ###
