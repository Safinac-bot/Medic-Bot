Medical Control Guideline: DRUG REFERENCE – ATROPINE Ref. No. 1317.9 
 
 
REVISED: 07-01-24                                        PAGE 1 OF 1 
Classification 
 Anticholinergic 
 
LA County Prehospital Indications  
Cardiac Dysrhythmia: symptomatic bradycardia in adults; suspected AV Block or increased vagal tone in 
pediatrics 
Hazmat exposure: organophosphate/pesticide/nerve agent poisoning with heart rate < 60 bpm, respiratory 
depression and/or extreme salivation 
 
Other Common Indications (Not authorized for EMS administration in LA County) 
End-of-life care, to dry secretions for patient comfort 
Eye disorders requiring mydriasis (pupillary dilation) for treatment/testing, administered as eye drop 
GI disorders caused by hypermobility (chronic diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome) 
 
Adult Dose 
Cardiac Dysrhythmia  
1mg (10mL) IV/IO push repeat every 3-5 min prn, maximum total dose 3mg 
Organophosphate poisoning 
2mg (20mL) IV/IO may repeat every 5 min until patient is asymptomatic 
Pediatric Dose 
Cardiac Dysrhythmia  
 0.02mg/kg (0.1mg/mL) IV/IO, dose per MCG 1309, may repeat x1 in 5 min 
Organophosphate poisoning  
0.05mg/kg (0.1mg/mL) IV/IO, may be repeated every 5 min, maximum total dose 5mg 
 
Mechanism of Action 
Competitively inhibits action of acetylcholine on autonomic effectors innervated by postganglionic nerves 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Peak effect in 20-30 min IM, 2-4 min IV/IO, duration 4 hr 
 
Contraindications 
Tachycardia 
Thyrotoxicosis 
 
Interactions 
 None for IV/IM/IO administration 
 
Adverse Effects 
Dry mouth / Thirst 
Dysrhythmias  
Flushed dry skin 
Hypertension / Hypotension 
Hyperthermia 
Increased intraocular pressure 
Mydriasis (pupil dilation) 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Use cautiously if myocardial infarction and/or ischemia is suspected, as atropine will increase 
myocardial O
2 
demand, which may worsen the infarct. 
• Bradycardia due to 2
nd
 degree type II and 3
rd
 degree heart blocks will not improve with atropine; if 
treatment indicated, transcutaneous pacing (TCP) should be performed.
