Classification 
 Sympathomimetic 
 
LA County Prehospital Indications 
Anaphylaxis 
Cardiac Arrest – Non-Traumatic: cardiac arrest resuscitation, hypotension after return of spontaneous 
 circulation (ROSC) not responsive to IV fluid resuscitation 
Cardiac Dysrhythmia: symptomatic bradycardia not responsive to atropine and transcutaneous pacing for 
 adults; and for symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to oxygenation and ventilation for pediatric 
 patients 
Respiratory Distress / Bronchospasm: asthma, reactive bronchospasm (unlikely to benefit in COPD) 
Airway Obstruction: stridor or visible airway swelling, croup/tracheitis in pediatrics 
Shock / Hypotension: non-traumatic hypotension not responsive to IV fluid resuscitation 
 
Other Common Indications (Not authorized for EMS administration in LA County) 
 None 
 
Adult Dose 
Anaphylaxis 
0.5mg (1mg/mL) IM in the lateral thigh, may repeat every 10 min x2 prn, maximum total 3 doses 
Cardiac Arrest 
1mg (0.1mg/mL) 10mL IV/IO may repeat every 5 min x2, maximum total dose 3mg 
Non-traumatic shock (including from symptomatic bradycardia or after ROSC) 
Push-dose epinephrine – mix 9mL normal saline with 1mL epinephrine 0.1mg/mL (IV formulation) 
in a 10mL syringe. Administer push-dose epinephrine 1mL IV/IO every 1-5 min as needed to 
maintain SBP >90mmHg 
Respiratory Distress/Bronchospasm 
0.5mg (1mg/mL) IM in the lateral thigh 
Airway Obstruction - Stridor 
 Epinephrine (1mg/mL solution) administer 5mg (5mL) via neb, repeat x1 in 10 min prn 
Airway Obstruction – Airway swelling 
Epinephrine (1mg/mL) administer 0.5mg (0.5mL) IM, repeat every 10 min prn x2, maximum total 
3 doses 
Pediatric Dose 
Anaphylaxis   
0.01mg/kg (1mg/mL) IM, dose per MCG 1309, in the lateral thigh, may repeat every 10 min x2 prn 
for persistent symptoms, maximum total 3 doses 
Cardiac Arrest 
0.01mg/kg (0.1mg/mL) IV/IO, dose per MCG 1309, may repeat every 5 min, maximum single dose 
1mg, and maximum 3 total doses 
Cardiac Dysrhythmia - Symptomatic bradycardia 
0.01mg/kg (0.1mg/mL) slow IV/IO push, dose per MCG 1309 
Shock / Hypotension (including hypotension after ROSC) 
Push-dose epinephrine – mix 9mL normal saline with 1mL epinephrine (0.1mg/mL) IV formulation 
in a 10mL syringe. Administer push-dose epinephrine (0.01mg/mL), dose per MCG 1309 every 1-5 
min as needed to maintain SBP >70mmHg 
Respiratory Distress/Bronchospasm 
 Epinephrine (1mg/mL) 0.01mg/kg IM in the lateral thigh, dose per MCG 1309 
Airway obstruction – Stridor from croup/tracheitis 
<1 year old: Epinephrine (1mg/mL) 2.5mL via neb, dose per MCG 1309 
≥ 1 year of age: Epinephrine (1mg/mL) 5mL via neb, dose per MCG 1309 
Repeat x1 in 10 min prn, maximum 2 total doses prior to Base contact 
Airway obstruction - Airway swelling

Mechanism of Action 
A naturally occurring catecholamine. Acts directly on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. It is the most 
potent activator of alpha receptors vasoconstricting the aorta and peripheral vasculature. Beta 1 stimulation 
increases inotropy, chronotropy, and AV conduction. Beta 2 stimulation causes bronchial smooth muscle 
relaxation and vasodilation to internal organs and skeletal muscles. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is < 2 min IV, 1-3 min IM; duration is 5-10 min IV, 20-30 min IM 
 
Contraindications 
None 
 
Interactions 
Can be partially deactivated by highly alkaline solutions, such as sodium bicarbonate. 
 
Adverse Effects 
Anxiety 
CVA or MI (rare, IV only) 
Hypertension 
Palpitations 
Tachydysrhythmias 
Tremors 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Inadvertent IV injection of usual IM formulation and dose constitutes a 10-fold overdose that can result 
in sudden severe hypertension and possible cerebral hemorrhage.
