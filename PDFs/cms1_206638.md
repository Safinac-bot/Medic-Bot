BIOTERRORISM SYNDROMES
If you suspect disease from a potential bioterrorism event, call the LACDHS Acute Communicable Disease Control Unit (ACDC) IMMEDIATELY:
Tel: (213) 240-7941 or after hours (213) 974-1234
ACDC will arrange for specialized lab testing; guidelines for treatment, prophylaxis, and infection control; and activate local, state, and federal emergency response systems.
Inhalational Anthrax
Abrupt onset of fever, chest pain,
respiratory distress without radi-
ographic findings of pneumonia, no
history of trauma or chronic disease,
progression to shock and death with-
in 24-36 hours.
Pneumonic Plague
Apparent severe community-acquired
pneumonia but with hemoptysis,
cyanosis, gastrointestinal symptoms,
shock.
Ricin (aerosolized)
Acute onset of fever, chest pain and
cough, progressing to respiratory
distress and hypoxemia; not
improved with antibiotics; death in
36-72 hours.
Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B
Acute onset of fever, chills,
headache, nonproductive cough and
myalgia (influenza-like illness) with a
NORMALchest x- ray.
Smallpox
Papular rash with fever that begins on the
face and extremities and uniformly
progresses to vesicles and pustules;
headache, vomiting,back pain, and
delirium common.
Viral Hemorrhagic Fever
(e. g., Ebola)
Fever with mucous membrane bleed-
ing,petechiae, thrombocytopenia and
hypotension in a patient without
underlying malignancy.
Botulism
Acute bilateral descending flaccid
paralysis beginning with cranial
nerve palsies.
Encephalitis (Venezuelan,
Eastern, Western)
Encephalopathy with fever and
seizures and/or focal neurologic
deficits.
Brucellosis
Irregular fever, chills, malaise,
headache, weight loss, profound
weakness and fatigue. Arthralgias,
sacroiliitis,paravertebral abscesses.
Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diar-
rhea, hepatosplenomegaly. May
have cough and pleuritic chest pain.
Tularemia (Typhoidal, Pneumonic)
Fever, chills, rigors, headache, myal-
gias, coryza, sore throat initially; fol-
lowed by weakness, anorexia, weight
loss. Substernal discomfort, dry cough if
pneumonic disease.
Chest x-ray with widened mediastinum;
gram-positive bacilli in sputum or blood;
definitive testing available at the LAC Public
Health Laboratory, (213) 250-8619.
Gram-negative bacilli or coccobacilli in
sputum, blood or lymph node; safety-
pin appearance with Wright or Giemsa
stain; definitive testing available at the
LAC Public Health Laboratory,
(213) 250-8619.
Chest x-ray with pulmonary edema.
Consult with ACDC regarding speci-
men collection and diagnostic testing
procedures.
Primarily clinical diagnosis. Consult with
ACDC regarding specimen collection
and diagnostic testing procedures.
Clinical with laboratory confirmation;
vaccinated, gowned and gloved person
obtains specimens (scabs or swabs of
vesicular or pustular fluid). Call ACDC
immediately before obtaining specimen;
definitive testing available through CDC.
Definitive testing available through
public health laboratory network--call
ACDC immediately.
CSF protein normal; EMG with repetitive
nerve stimulation shows augmentation
of muscle action potential; toxin assays
of serum, feces, or gastric aspirate
available at the LAC Public Health
Laboratory. Call ACDC to request testing.
Serologic testing available at the LAC
Public Health Laboratory, (213) 250-8619.
Tiny, slow-growing, faintly-staining,
gram-negative coccobacilli in blood or
bone marrow culture. Leukocyte count
normal or low. Anemia, thrombocytopenia
possible. CXR nonspecific: normal,
bronchopneumonia, abscesses, single
or miliary nodules, enlarged hilar
nodes, effusions. Serologic testing and
culture available at the LAC Public
Health Laboratory, (213) 250-8619.
Small, faintly-staining, slow-growing,
gram-negative coccobacilli in smears
or cultures of sputum, blood. CXR may
show infiltrate, hilar adenopathy, effusion.
Definitive testing available at the LAC
Public Health Laboratory, (213) 250-8619.
