Board Eligible (BE): Successful completion of a residency training program with progression to 
board certification based on the timeframe as specified by the ABMS or AOA for a specific 
specialty. 
 
Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO): Provision of oxygen and carbon dioxide 
exchange through the use of extracorporeal circuit consisting minimally of a blood pump, 
artificial lung, and vascular access cannula, using blood flows sufficient to support oxygenation 
and concomitantly enhance carbon dioxide removal. Also known as extracorporeal life support 
(ECLS). 
 
ECMO Candidate: A patient with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that meets LA County EMS 
criteria for consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; this includes patients with 
initial shockable rhythm refractory to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation or with

specializes in the management and operation of the ECMO machine.  
 
ECMO Specialist: A technical specialist trained to manage the ECMO machine and the needs 
of the patient on ECMO. 
 
ECPR Medical Director: A qualified physician specialist privileged by the hospital to perform 
cannulation and active in performing ECMO who is responsible for the ECMO program. 
 
ECPR Program Manager: A physician, advanced practitioner, registered nurse (RN),
