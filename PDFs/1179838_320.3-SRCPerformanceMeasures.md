PURPOSE: To provide standardized quantifiable indicators to assess and evaluate the 
performance, quality of care and program management of designated STEMI 
Receiving Centers (SRC). 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
 
Door to Balloon Time (D2B): A time measurement that starts with the patient’s arrival in the 
emergency department and ends when the first device (excluding guidewire) intervened at the 
culprit lesion during the first percutaneous coronary intervention. 
 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) Time: Time 12-Lead ECG was obtained. 
 
Emergency Department (ED) Door Time: Time of patient arrival at the ED. 
 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI): A procedure used to open or widen a narrowed 
or blocked coronary artery to restore blood flow supplying the heart. 
 
Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC): Following cardiopulmonary arrest, ROSC is the 
restoration of a spontaneous perfusing rhythm.  Signs of ROSC include: palpable pulse, 
breathing (more than an occasional gasp), a measurable blood pressure and/or a sudden rise 
in capnography to a normal/high reading. 
 
STEMI Referral Facility (SRF) Time: Time of patient arrival at the ED of the STEMI Referral 
Facility 
 
Targeted Temperature Management (TTM): Maintaining body temperature at a target 
between 32 and 37.5 degrees Celsius in a person for a specific duration of time for the purpose 
of preserving neurological function post cardiac arrest. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. The SRC shall meet compliance threshold on all performance measures to maintain 
SRC Designation.
