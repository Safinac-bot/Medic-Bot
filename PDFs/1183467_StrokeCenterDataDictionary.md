The ICH Score is a clinical grading scale composed of factors related to a basic 
neurological examination (GCS), a baseline patient characteristic (age), and initial 
neuroimaging (ICH volume, IVH, infratentorial/supratentorial origin). Score 
documentation may range from 0 to 6. The purpose of this grading scale is to provide a 
standard assessment tool that can be easily and rapidly determined at the time of ICH 
presentation by physicians without special training in stroke neurology and that will allow 
consistency in communication and treatment selection in clinical care and clinical 
research.       
      
Field Values: 
• Integer 0 – 6 
Additional Information 
• Enter the total score of the first ICH score performed within 24 hours of hospital 
arrival and prior to the initiation of any invasive intracranial procedure. 
• First ICH score can be recorded by a physician/APN/PA or nurse.

ACUTE VASCULAR IMAGING OR PERFUSION IMAGING 
PERFORMED? 
GWTG Definition  
Record if additional imaging was performed in the acute evaluation for the purpose of 
diagnosing large vessel occlusion (LVO) for the patient. Intent of the element is to 
determine if detection of large-vessel occlusion by means of intracranial vascular 
imaging was performed prior to initiating clinical decisions for treatment. Most large 
strokes are caused by occlusion in ≥ 1 large vessel. 
 
Field Values 
• Yes 
• No 
 
Additional Information 
• Select “Yes” if patient had intracranial vascular imaging performed for diagnosing 
large vessel occlusion(s) prior to initiating treatment for acute ischemic stroke. 
• Select “No” if there was no advanced imaging assessed at your hospital for 
diagnosing large vessel occlusion(s) prior to initiating treatment for the patient. 
• Select “No” if no documentation in the patient's medical record or unknown.

TARGET LESION/ LVO VISUALIZED 
 
GWTG Definition 
Record if a proximal large vessel occlusion (LVO) was identified upon reviewing the 
advanced brain imaging (e.g. CTA, MRA, DSA). Intent of the question is to 
determine if patient had a large vessel intracranial occlusion in the imaging. 
 
Field Values 
• Yes 
• No/ ND 
   
Additional Information 
• Examples include clots located in the following locations: basilar, posterior or 
anterior cerebral artery; internal cerebral artery; or spenoidal (M1) or insula (M2) 
branch of the middle cerebral artery  
• Yes: There was presence of large vessel occlusions identified (or visualized) upon 
reviewing the vascular imaging. 
• No/ND: There were no large vessel occlusions identified (or visualized) upon 
reviewing the vascular imaging OR No documentation in the medical record that 
indicates presence of large vessel occlusion for vascular imaging completed for this 
episode of care. 
• An occlusion is complete or near complete blockage of the artery. 
• A "target lesion" is referring to a proximal large vessel occlusion. 
• A large-vessel occlusion typically causes severe stroke and independently predicts 
poor neurological outcome and is a stronger predictor of "neurological deterioration." 
Thus, detection of large-vessel occlusion by means of noninvasive intracranial 
vascular imaging greatly improves the ability to make appropriate clinical decisions.

not initiated because of a bleeding disorder unless documentation explicitly states 
so.)

THROMBOLYSIS IN CEREBRAL INFACTION (TICI) POST-
TREATMENT REPERFUSION GRADE 
 
GWTG Definition 
The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) Reperfusion Grade is used to 
measure cerebral reperfusion. Results with this scoring system range between zero 
and three: 0 (no perfusion); 1 (perfusion past the initial occlusion, but no distal 
branch filling); 2 (perfusion with incomplete or slow distal branch filling); and 3 (full 
perfusion with filling of all distal branches). 
 
Field Values 
• Grade 0 
• Grade 1 
• Grade 2a 
• Grade 2b 
• Grade 3 
• ND 
 
Additional Information 
• Used only in patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke 
• Grade 2a: Partial tissue reperfusion in < 50% of the occluded artery. 
• Grade 2b: Partial reperfusion in ≥50% of the occluded artery territory. 
• TICI grade must be documented by a Physician/APN/PA, or a nurse (RN), circulating 
nurse, operating room technician, radiology technician or other individual designated 
to scribe during the procedure.

MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE AT DISCHARGE 
GWTG Definition 
Documentation in the medical record of a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) completed 
at time of discharge. The Modified Rankin Score (mRS) is a 6- point disability scale 
with possible scores ranging from 0 to 5. A separate category of 6 is usually added 
for patients who expire. 
 
Field Values 
• Yes 
• No/ND 
 
Additional Information 
• Yes – A Modified Rankin Scale was performed at discharge 
• No/ND – A Modified Rankin Scale was not performed or was performed but the total 
score is not available. 
• This mRS assessment is intended to measure disability at the time of discharge. If 
there is more than 1 measured, use the mRS measured closest to hospital discharge. 
Ideally the mRS will be measured at discharge. 
• If a mRS measurement has not been documented in the medical record, but sufficient 
information is available from the physical therapy (PT) notes, occupational therapy 
(OT) notes, and/or other sources to allow a mRS to be assigned retrospectively 
assigned mRS score may be entered into the case report form. Select "Yes" to this 
data element and enter the findings under Total Score. 
• If the mRS is not measured or documented and a mRS cannot be assigned 
retrospectively, then select "No/ND."

patient. 
 
Field Values 
• Integer 0 – 6 
 
Additional Information 
• The values 0 – 6 correspond to the mRS documented at the time of discharge 
o 0 = No disability 
o 1 = No significant disability: despite symptoms: able to carry out all usual 
duties and activities. 
o 2 = Slight disability: unable to carry out all routine activities but able to 
look after own affairs without assistance. 
o 3 = Moderate disability: requiring some help, but able to walk without 
assistance. 
o 4 = Moderately severe disability: unable to walk without assistance, and 
unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance. 
o 5 = Severe disability: bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant 
nursing care and attention. 
o 6 = Dead
