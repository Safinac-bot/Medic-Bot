Base Hospital Contact Required. 
 
1. Assess airway and initiate basic and/or advanced airway maneuvers prn (MCG 1302) 
Continually assess patient’s airway and ventilation status 
 
2. Administer Oxygen prn (MCG 1302) 
High-flow Oxygen 15L/min for all patients in shock, regardless of SpO
2
 ❶ 
 
3. Maintain supine if respiratory status allows ❷ 
 
4. Establish vascular access (MCG 1375)  
For patients with hypotension or clinical evidence of poor perfusion (MCG 1355), establish IO 
catheter if unable to obtain peripheral venous access after 2 attempts ❸ 
 
For IO placement in alert patients administer Lidocaine 2% 0.5mg/kg (20mg/mL) slow IO push, 
dose per MCG 1309, may repeat once for infusion pain at half initial dose 
 
5. Initiate cardiac monitoring (MCG 1308) 
 
6. Apply blanket to keep patient warm ❹ 
 
7. Consider etiology ❺ 
For neonates, treat in conjunction with TP 1216-P, Newborn/Neonatal Resuscitation 
For patients with dysrhythmia, treat in conjunction with TP 1212-P, Cardiac Dysrhythmia – 
Bradycardia or TP 1213-P, Cardiac Dysrhythmia – Tachycardia 
For patients with traumatic injury, treat per TP 1244-P, Traumatic Injury 
For concern of overdose or toxic exposure, treat in conjunction with TP 1241-P, Overdose / 
Poisoning / Ingestion 
For patients with suspected sepsis, treat in conjunction with TP 1204-P, Fever/Sepsis 
 
8. Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV/IO rapid infusion per MCG 1309 
 
9. For patients with isolated hypotension without signs of poor perfusion and those who rapidly 
respond without intervention or to < 20mL/kg Normal Saline document Hypotension (HOTN) as 
Provider Impression. For patients with hypotension with poor perfusion that require addition 
normal saline or push-dose epinephrine document as Shock (SHOK) 
 
10. CONTACT BASE for shock and for additional Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV/IO per MCG1309 
 
11. If clinical evidence of poor perfusion persists despite fluid infusion or pulmonary edema develops 
requiring cessation of fluid administration: 
Push-dose Epinephrine – mix 9mL Normal Saline with 1mL Epinephrine (0.1mg/mL) IV 
formulation in a 10mL syringe; administer Push-dose Epinephrine (0.01 mg/mL), dose per 
MCG 1309 every 1-5 minutes as needed to maintain normal SBP per MCG 1309 until hospital 
arrival ❻ 
CONTACT BASE concurrent with initial dose of Push-dose Epinephrine

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Shock is inadequate tissue perfusion, equivalent to poor perfusion for the purposes of this protocol. 
Consider Base Hospital Contact if hypotension/shock of unclear etiology.  Use caution if the patient 
has known cyanotic congenital heart disease. Newborns requiring positive-pressure ventilation 
should receive 90 seconds of room air, and then start oxygen 15L/min if heart rate remains < 100 
beats per minute and/or persistent shock. 
 
❷    Maintaining a patient supine improves perfusion to vital organs; raising the lower limbs does not 
provide additional benefit. However, not all patients will tolerate a supine position, which can further 
compromise respiratory function and airway patency.  
 
❸ Peripheral venous access may be difficult to obtain in infants and small children. Consider IO 
placement as primary vascular access in extremis patients for whom venous access is unlikely to be 
achieved rapidly. For older children, make two attempts at venous access and, if unsuccessful, place 
an IO for vascular access.   
 
❹ Exposure to cold increases the likelihood of bleeding complications. 
 
❺  There are many etiologies of shock. The treatment protocols referenced here contain guidance on 
specific interventions beyond what is contained in this treatment protocol. The level of systolic blood 
pressure varies by age and thresholds for hypotension are found in MCG 1309 and can be used in 
decisions for fluid resuscitation. Hypotension is a late finding in pediatric shock; fluid resuscitation 
should be guided by clinical evidence of poor perfusion (MCG 1355). Consider Base Hospital Contact 
if hypotension/shock of unclear etiology. 
 
❻    Push-dose Epinephrine is appropriate for non-traumatic shock including cardiogenic shock. 
Additional doses beyond 10mL may need to be prepared for prolonged transports.  For patients         
< 10kg, transfer the diluted Push-dose Epinephrine to a smaller (1mL or 3mL) syringe in order to 
administer the dose accurately.
