As we close 2022, we reflect on the resilience 
of  the  EMS  community  to  respond  to  the  pan-
demic,  strategize  to  address  workforce  chal-
lenges,  and  have  the  capacity  to  continue  to  
innovate  in  prehospital  
care.   As   a   system   we   
continue  to  review  our  
data  to  address  trends  
as  well  as  to  improve  
our service to the public 
through  incorporation  of  
the  latest  evidence  into  
our  treatment  protocols  
and    medical    control    
guidelines. This year we 
have      modified      our      
treatment  protocols  for  
the  care  of  patients  with  behavioral  or  psychi-
atric  crises  and  have  introduced  new  medical  
control  guideline  for  the  care  of  the  patient  
with  agitation.  We  also  introduced  the  supra-
glottic  airway,  the  i-gel,  for  both  adults  and  
children  which  will  expand  the  options  for  air-
way  management  for  all  patients  with  critical  
illness or injury. We applaud our EMS provider 
agencies’   innovation   for   participation   in   a   
number  of  pilot  projects  such  as  the  use  of  
telemedicine  in  dispatch  to  direct  care  with  
advance  practice  providers,  use  of  telemedi-
cine  in  the  evaluation  of  patients  with  behavioral  
health  complaints  and  transport  to  the  most  ap-
propriate  healthcare  center  including  psychiatric  
urgent care centers, and the use of extracorpore-
al  membrane  oxygenation  (ECMO)  for  care  of  se-
lect  patients  with  persistent    shockable  cardiac  
arrest. Finally, as a system we are participating in 
a large National Institutes of Health (NIH) study to 
evaluate “usual care” versus age-based dosing of 
midazolam  for  children  with  seizures.  Participa-
tion  in  this  trial  allows  for  the  system  to  receive  
additional  education  in  care  of  children  with  sei-
zures  and  provides  the  opportunity  for  us  to  ex-
pand   our   knowledge   on   
safe   and   quality   care   of   
children  with  seizures  and  
provides    the    opportunity    
for    us    to    expand    our    
knowledge   on   safe   and   
quality  care  of  these  pedi-
atric   patients.   Overall   we   
continue  to  address  daily  
EMS  system  service  needs  
as we explore with our EMS 
stakeholder   partners   new   
discoveries   and   improve-
ments  in  prehospital  care  that  can  be  integrated  
into our EMS system to optimize care for the citi-
zens of Los Angeles County.

Injury Severity Score by Mechanism of Injury 
Injury Severity Score (ISS): Is an established medical score to assess trauma severity. It correlates with 
mortality, morbidity and hospitalization time after trauma. It is used to define the term major trauma. 
A major trauma (or polytrauma) is defined as the ISS being greater than 15.
