exercises and drills. 
 
PRINCIPLE: 
 
1. Exercises are an important component of preparedness, by providing the whole 
community with the opportunity to shape planning, assess and validate capabilities,  
 
2.  Disaster preparedness exercises/drills should involve but not limited to active 
participation from Health Care Coalition (HCC) partners which includes: prehospital care 
personnel, hospital, ancillary healthcare providers (Ambulatory Surgery Centers, 
Community Clinics, Coroner, Dialysis Centers, Emergency Management Departments, 
Home Health and Hospice Center, Long Term Care Centers) and EMS Agency staff to 
improve coordination and communication between all involved entities. 
 
3. Participation in County-facilitated exercises and drills will adhere to the Homeland 
Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP) standard, to ensure a consistent 
and effective approach to exercise design, conduct, and evaluation.  
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Participation in an annual exercise that includes all HCC partners and governmental 
agencies. (e.g., Statewide Medical & Health Exercise [SWMHE], Medical Response and 
Surge Exercise [MRSE], etc.) 
 
A. Hospitals and clinics participating in the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) 
are required to participate in the annual exercise designated by the HPP exercise 
planning team. 
 
B. When invited by a hospital or clinic, provider agencies should participate in the 
annual exercise designated by the HPP exercise planning team, including 
exercise planning sessions and after-action debriefings conducted by the hospital 
or clinic, whenever possible. 
 
C. In the case of a real incident the annual exercise designated by the HPP exercise 
planning team may be cancelled.

September and December.  The poll will begin at 3:00 PM and each 
participating facility will be called. 
 
3. The drill will conclude once all participants have responded to the roll call 
or after three attempts, whichever comes first.   
 
4. The EMS Agency will contact non-respondents by email or phone after 
the drill concludes to notify the hospital that they were not connected to 
the LA DRC network or that a response was not heard.

agencies and the EMS Agency to expediently and efficiently determine patient 
destinations based on resource availability of hospitals. 
 
1. The provider agency generally initiates the drill by: 
 
a. Pre-arranged drill – EMS Agency is notified in advance and 
provided with specific information regarding the date, time and 
nature of the drill. 
 
b. Random unannounced drill – EMS Agency is contacted by the 
provider agency without prior notification. The EMS Agency may 
poll hospitals for resource availability or provide patient destination 
as requested by the provider agency. 
 
2. The EMS Agency may request a pre-arranged MCI drill with a provider 
agency for training purposes of MAC staff. 
 
3. Analysis and evaluation of the drill may be conducted jointly by the 
provider agency and the MAC. 
 
E. Regional Exercises/Drills – designed to train, test and validate plans and 
capabilities, and identify areas for improvement amongst the HCC partners. 
 
1. All HPP participants will participate in exercises and drills in conjunction 
 with LAC and community partners to ensure preparedness, as per the 
 HPP exhibit (e.g., Regional decontamination drill, annual Table Top
