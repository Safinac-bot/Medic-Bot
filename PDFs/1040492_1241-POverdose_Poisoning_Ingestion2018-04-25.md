SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶ The first priority for apneic patients after narcotic overdose is to begin positive pressure ventilation.  
Once ventilations are established, naloxone should be administered with the goal of restoring 
spontaneous ventilations.  Vascular access should not take priority over initial treatment with 
Naloxone (IN or IM) for patients with suspected opiate overdose. Patients who are awake and alert 
with normal respirations after naloxone therapy may not require IV access or additional doses of 
naloxone. 
 
❷  Higher dose pre-packaged nasal spray should not be used in the newborn/neonate due to potential    
risk to precipitate withdrawal. 
 
❸   Signs of calcium channel overdose include bradycardia along with hypotension and hyperglycemia. 
Signs of beta blocker overdose include bradycardia along with hypotension and hypoglycemia.  
Consider when the patient is taking or has access to a calcium channel and/or beta blocker 
medication. Ask about potential exposures including medications in the home. 
 
❹   ECG findings consistent with tricyclic overdose include wide QRS (>0.12mm) and terminal R in aVR. 
Consider when the patient is taking or has access to a tricyclic medication. Ask about potential 
exposures including medications in the home.  
 
❺  EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect. Communicate concerns about 
child abuse and/or neglect to accepting ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for 
harm (e.g., unkempt home, evidence of drug or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or 
suspected domestic violence), when the history does not match with the severity of physical findings 
(e.g., child posturing after a roll off the couch), when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular 
burns as from a cigarette, whip marks on the skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports 
physical or sexual abuse. Children < 3 years of age and those with developmental delay are at 
increased risk of abuse. This must also be accompanied by notification to Department of Children 
and Family Services.
