Base Hospital Contact:  Required for vaginal bleeding at > 20 weeks pregnancy and newborn 
delivery ❶ ❷ ❸ ❹ 
   
1. Do not delay transport for treatment if suspected eclampsia; Manage delivery en route  
 
2. Assess airway and initiate basic and/or advanced airway maneuvers prn (MCG 1302) 
 
3. Administer Oxygen prn (MCG 1302) 
 
4. Establish vascular access (MCG 1375) 
Vascular access should not take precedence over controlled delivery or emergency transport 
 
5. For poor perfusion (MCG 1355): 
Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV/IO rapid infusion per MCG 1309 
CONTACT BASE for persistent poor perfusion to obtain order for additional Normal Saline 
20mL/kg IV/IO per MCG 1309 
 
6. If crown is showing with amniotic sac intact, pinch sac and twist the membrane to rupture 
 
  BREECH DELIVERY 
 
7. Support presenting part and allow newborn to deliver 
 
8. If head does not deliver, place gloved hand inside mother and form “V” formed with fingers by 
baby’s face to provide an opening for the airway 
 
  PROLAPSED CORD 
 
9. Manually elevate presenting fetal part off the umbilical cord; maintain elevation of the presenting 
part until transfer of care ❺ 
 
10. Wrap cord with moist gauze 
 
NUCHAL CORD 
 
11. If nuchal cord is loose attempt slipping the cord over the head prior to delivery 
 
12. If the cord is too tight to easily slip over the head, clamp the cord in two places 1 inch apart and  
         cut the cord with scissors 
 
 
 
SHOULDER DYSTOCIA 
 
13. Perform McRobert’s maneuver with suprapubic pressure in order to deliver the anterior shoulder

MATERNAL HYPERTENSION (BP ≥ 140/90mmHg) / ECLAMPSIA ❼ 
 
14. Place mother in left lateral decubitus position 
 
15. For seizure, treat in conjunction with TP 1231-P, Seizure 
 
POST-PARTUM HEMORRHAGE ❽ 
 
18. Massage the mother’s lower abdomen (fundal massage) 
 
19. Establish 2 IVs, large bore catheter (16g or 18g) preferred 
 
20. Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV/IO rapid infusion per MCG 1309 
CONTACT BASE for persistent poor perfusion to obtain order for additional Normal Saline 
20mL/kg IV/IO per MCG 1309

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶    Pediatric patients who are pregnant must be evaluated for child maltreatment and are at high risk for 
complications during delivery for the mother and the newborn. 
 
❷    This protocol was intended for complications of pregnancy at the time of delivery; if patient is known  
      to be pregnant and has complaints not associated with labor or delivery treat per TP 1202-P, General  
      Medical or most applicable protocol. 
 
❸    If the patient has vaginal bleeding associated with known pregnancy >20 weeks, Contact Base and 
communicate signs and symptoms so that the receiving hospital can pre-notify OB consultants as 
needed. 
 
❹    Any delivery after the first trimester (12 weeks) should be considered childbirth for the purposes of 
this treatment protocol and paramedics should contact Base to discuss the management and 
transport. In general, delivery prior to 20 weeks gestation is nonviable and does not require 
resuscitation. However, dates can be incorrectly estimated, therefore, Base Contact is strongly 
encouraged. Any potentially viable birth should be resuscitated in the field and transported to a 
perinatal center that is also an EDAP (with a NICU if ≤34 weeks gestation). Births prior to 20 weeks 
do not necessarily require specialty center care and can be transported to the MAR. 
  
❺ In addition to manually elevating the presenting part from the umbilical cord, placing the patient in 
Trendelenburg position during transport can help to elevate the presenting part off the cord to 
maintain blood flow to the fetus. Do not attempt to push a prolapsed cord back in. 
 
❻ Shoulder dystocia is inability to deliver the anterior shoulder, which usually occurs in large newborns.  
If delivery fails to progress after head delivers, hyperflex mother’s hips tightly in knee to chest 
position and apply firm suprapubic pressure in attempt to dislodge anterior shoulder (McRobert’s 
maneuver). 
 
❼     Hypertension in a pregnant or recently post-partum is a sign of eclampsia, which required immediate 
emergency and obstetric care. Additional signs of eclampsia are edema and seizures. Patients who 
are ≥ 20 weeks pregnant or ≤ 6 weeks post-partum with hypertension (BP ≥ 140/90mmHg should be 
transported to a Perinatal Center for evaluation. 
 
❽   Some bleeding is normal during delivery, typically up to 500mL. Bleeding is reduced with fundal 
massage after placental delivery, which promotes contraction of the uterus. Post-partum hemorrhage 
is defined as blood loss with signs of poor perfusion and/or cumulative blood loss ≥1000mLs.
