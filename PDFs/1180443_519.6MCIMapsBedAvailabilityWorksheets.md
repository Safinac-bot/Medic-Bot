PURPOSE: To provide paramedic providers, base hospitals, and the Medical Alert Center 
(MAC) with Regional Multi-Casualty Incident (MCI) Maps and corresponding Bed 
Availability Worksheets of all Los Angeles County, and the surrounding counties, 
9-1-1 receiving facilities. The maps and worksheets are to assist with determining 
patient destinations from the scene of an MCI to an appropriate 9-1-1 receiving 
facility. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. The paramedic provider and the MAC shall refer to the MCI Map(s) to estimate the 
approximate location, regional designation (North, South, East, and West) and to identify 
all potential 9-1-1 receiving facilities. If an MCI is located near a regional border, it may 
be necessary to refer to more than one regional map and corresponding worksheet. 
 
2. The paramedic provider shall document 9-1-1 receiving hospital bed availability using 
the MCI Bed Availability Worksheets or equivalent whenever possible. 
 
3. The MCI Maps and corresponding Bed Availability Worksheets are important tools to 
assist the paramedic provider, paramedic base hospital, and the MAC to ensure that 
MCI patients are appropriately distributed throughout the 9-1-1 receiving hospital 
system.
