SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶ Scene safety includes the assessment for the presence of firearms or weapons, including 
observations and direct inquiry with the patient and any available/relevant third parties (e.g., family, 
caregivers, or witnesses). If a weapon is found on the scene, EMS personnel should notify all 
members on the scene, and contact law enforcement (LE) immediately. 
 
❷    Psychiatric, including mental health and substance abuse, emergencies are medical emergencies, 
and as such are best treated by EMS personnel. Those patients with psychiatric emergencies 
presenting with agitation, violence, threats of harm to self or others, or criminal activity are best 
managed by an EMS and LE co-response.  
 
❸    Always attempt verbal de-escalation first and avoid applying restraints to patients who do not present 
a threat to self or EMS personnel (Ref. No. 838, Application of Patient Restraints) 
 
❹     Many medical causes of psychiatric symptoms exist: 
Agitation (see MCG 1307) 
Acute pain 
Head trauma 
Infection 
Encephalitis or Encephalopathy 
Exposure to environmental toxins 
Metabolic derangement 
Hypoxia 
Thyroid disease or other hormone irregularity 
Neurological disease 
Toxic levels of medications 
Alcohol or recreational drugs: intoxication or withdrawal 
Exacerbation of a primary psychiatric illness 
Autism Spectrum Disorder 
Psychosis 
Delirium  
Chronic neurological disease (dementia, seizures, parkinsonism, brain tumor) 
Steroid use, other medication reactions 
Alcohol or recreational drugs: intoxication or withdrawal 
Mania 
Delirium 
Thyrotoxicosis 
Alcohol or recreational drugs: intoxication or withdrawal 
Anxiety 
Respiratory disease 
Cardiac disease 
Thyroid disease 
Toxic levels of medications 
Alcohol or recreational drugs: intoxication or withdrawal 
Depression 
Reaction to medication 
Chronic disease or chronic pain

Hormonal variations 
Subclinical / clinical hypothyroidism 
Alcohol or recreational drugs: intoxication or withdrawal 
 
❺    Medications used for pharmacologic management of agitation may cause respiratory depression; 
administer only when necessary for the safety of the patients and/or EMS personnel. Apnea can 
occur suddenly and with little warning. Resuscitation equipment (oxygen and bag-mask ventilator) 
should be positioned near the patient and readily available prior to sedation. Every individual who 
receives restraint and/or midazolam pharmacologic management should be continuously monitored 
(including capnography when available) and transported for additional clinical assessment and 
treatment. 
 
❻   Use of restraints in severely agitated patients is associated with an increased risk of sudden death.     
Avoid using restraints in patients who do not present a threat to self or to EMS personnel. Monitor 
patients closely when restraints are applied. Never secure or transport a patient in restraints in prone 
position. 
❼    The IM or IN route is preferred unless an IV has been previously established. 
 
❽     Patients who are larger in size (e.g., ≥100kg) and/or pose a greater risk for harm due to their level of 
agitation and violence may require the higher dose of midazolam for adequate sedation. Patients in 
need of sedation who are smaller, frail, elderly or already exhibiting signs of fatigue should 
preferentially be treated with a 5mg dose, repeating if necessary, to reduce risk of oversedation and 
potential for apnea. 
 
❾     Patients who are agitated while in physical restraint and have the potential for injury due to the 
      degree of agitation, should receive medication by EMS personnel to reduce 
      agitation with continued monitoring for respiratory depression, in accordance with Ref 838, 
      Application of Patient Restraints. 
 
 ❿ Several drugs that may cause agitation and present similarly to a psychiatric crisis may also cause 
life threatening cardiac arrhythmias after intentional or accidental overdose. These arrhythmias are 
often preceded by prolonged QRS intervals (> 0.12 sec) or bradycardia. Cocaine intoxication is 
strongly associated with severe agitation and may also produce cardiac effects similar to Tricyclic 
antidepressant (TCA) overdose (widened QRS progressing to malignant arrhythmia). These patients 
may require a large dose of sodium bicarbonate to prevent sudden cardiac death. Consult Base 
Physician immediately to discussion administration of Sodium Bicarbonate; may repeat x1 if QRS 
remains > 0.12 sec after initial sodium bicarbonate. Treat in conjunction with TP 1241, Overdose / 
Poisoning / Ingestion  
 
⓫     Agitation may be present after a seizure, or in the setting of hypo/hyperglycemia. Consider checking 
           glucose early if the patient is a known diabetic or demonstrates clinical evidence of hypoglycemia, 
       but only if safe to do so. 
 
⓬     It is important to assess for any evidence of suicide attempt. If there is concern for overdose, ask the 
patient or bystanders to provide information on agents used (specifically what, when, and how much). 
Collect and transport any medication vials, or additional pills). This will assist in determining 
necessary antidote treatment and monitoring at the hospital. This information is often lost, if not 
obtained immediately on scene.

[13]    Patients with acute mental health or substance abuse crises may not be capable or willing to provide 
reliable information; therefore, it is important to obtain third party collateral information about the 
patient’s condition (e.g., from family, caregivers, witnesses), including names and contact information 
for persons knowledgeable about the patient’s illness, treatment and medications.
