The  2014  EMS  System  Data  
Report  provides  an  excellent  
opportunity  for  you  our  read-
ers  to  see  first-hand  the  ex-
pansion  of  the  EMS  Agency’s 
data  capabilities.    Since  last  
year’s  report,  the  number  of  
fire    departments        utilizing    
electronic patient care records 
increased 
from five   to   
11,  resulting  
in more time-
ly  and  accu-
rate        data

from        our        
provider     agen-
cies.      The  County’s  Hospital  
Specialty    Care    Center    pro-
grams continue to submit data 
that   provides   us   the   oppor-
tunity   to   measure   outcomes   
and  integrate  our  data  to  en-
sure  that  we  measure  the  en-
tire patient care continuum. 
The   EMS   Agency   strives   to   
provide data that: 
   Improves system transpar-
ency, public understanding of 
emergency medical incidents 
and the unique characteristics 
of emergency care delivery in 
specific areas of the County. 
   Is useful to system plan-
ners and results in informed 
public policy. 
   Identifies trends in injury 
and illness within Los Angeles 
County, identifying patient 
needs and opportunities for
