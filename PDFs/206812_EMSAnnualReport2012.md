Goal 2 - Highlight data gaps and 
its  impact  to  our  ability  when  
making   data   driven   decisions   
and  the  limitations  for  evaluat-
ing  the  quality  of  care  rendered  
to our patients. 
Goal  3  -  Demonstrate  how  the  
EMS system design parallels the 
healthcare needs of the commu-
nity  and  addresses  the  leading  
causes  of  death  and  disability  
(heart  attack,  stroke  and  trau-
ma)    as    reported    by    Public    
Health. 
We hope this report will 
provide you with a basic 
understanding    of    our    
system.  Future  use  of  
this data will help guide 
us  as  we  continue  to  
shape   the   system   to   
meet the ever changing 
community   needs.   This   
can be done only through 
the  cooperative  efforts  of  sys-
tem   stakeholders   and,   timely   
and accurate data collection. 
We are extremely happy to present 
the   first   systemwide   Emergency   
Medical   Services   (EMS)   System   
Data  Report.    The  EMS  Agency  is  
charged  with  the  coordination  of  
the  EMS  System  for  Los  Angeles  
County  (LA  Co),  which  is  
comprised of EMS Provid-
er  Agencies  (fire  depart-
ments,   ambulance   com-
panies  and  the  Sheriff’s  
Department) and      9-1-1 
receiving hospitals. 
The  EMS  Agency’s  role  in  
coordination   is   to   ensure   
that when a person calls 9-1-1 and 
requires   emergency   medical   ser-
vices,  they  will  receive  the  same  
quality medical service and access 
to the appropriate hospital capable 
of   meeting   their   medical   needs   
regardless of where they are in the 
County,  from  the  ocean  to  the  de-
sert.   Because   of   LA   Co’s   size,      
system coordination is a very com-
plex task.  
Since  its  inception  in  the  1970s,  
the  EMS  system  has  evolved  to  
address the major causes of death 
and  disability  by  regionalizing  trau-
ma,  cardiac,  stroke,  pediatric  and  
disaster   preparedness.   With   the   
support  of  the  Board  of  Supervi-
sors, the EMS Commission and our 
stakeholder     organiza-
tions, LA Co is recognized 
as one of the leading EMS 
systems   in   the   Country.   
For  years,  we  have  been  
utilizing our data but have 
not  taken  the  opportunity  
to  publish  a  comprehen-
sive  summary  for  the  com-
munity.  Our  current  data-
base   contains   over   12   
million    patient    records    
and is one of the nation’s 
largest     repositories     of     
EMS data. 
The   goals   of   this   data   
report include: 
Goal  1  -  Provide  EMS  data  
to  our  system  participants,  and  in  
doing so encourage them to recog-
nize the importance of their data in 
managing our system.

DATA FACTS 
Emergency Department Saturation 
In the last 16 years, hospitals have requested diversion of 
paramedic units from a low of 1.5 hrs/day/hospital in 1995 to a 
high of 6.5 hrs/day/hospital in 2005.  Although seasonal 
increases occur during the “flu” season, a significant overall 
increase in diversion hours was seen between the late 1990s 
and 2005.  The Hospital Association of Southern California (Los 
Angeles Area) and the EMS Agency collaborated to revise the 
diversion policy in order to mitigate the increasing diversion 
problem.  Diversion hours have stabilized in the last five years to 
an average of 2.4 hrs/day/hospital.
