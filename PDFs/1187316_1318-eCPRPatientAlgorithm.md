PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Some patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are refractory to conventional 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation have improved outcomes if extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) is used to provide ongoing resuscitation support. ECMO treatment for patient in cardiac 
arrest is called extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) or extracorporeal life 
support (ECLS).  
 
2. Currently it is not known exactly which patients are able to benefit from ECPR but certain patients 
including patients with refractory ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia (rVF/VT) cardiac 
arrest have been shown to have up to 30% improved survival. 
 
3. For all patients with OHCA, management should be conducted to minimize interruptions in chest 
compressions and prioritize standard therapies, including chest compressions and defibrillation 
for shockable rhythms, and early epinephrine for non-shockable rhythms. 
 
4. While usual protocols emphasize prolonged on scene resuscitation for rVF/VT, patients for whom 
ECPR is indicated and a mechanical compression device (MCD) is available to maintain quality 
chest compression during transport should be transported as soon as possible once ECPR 
criteria are met in order to minimize the low-flow time prior to cannulation for ECPR. Goal scene 
time is  no more than 15 minutes. 
 
5. Patients for whom there is a significant delay in transport due to extrication challenges or lack of 
MCD availability should be resuscitated on scene to achieve return of spontaneous circulation 
(ROSC) since ECPR is unlikely to be initiated in patients more than 60 minutes after cardiac 
arrest onset.   
 
6. Patients transported with ongoing resuscitation should have an advanced airway in place to 
ensure adequate ventilations during movement and transport,  and an Impedance Threshold 
Device (ITD) attached when available. 
 
7. Epinephrine beyond 3 doses is associated with worse outcomes in patients with rVF/VT. 
Additional epinephrine for patients who re-arrest into a non-shockable rhythm should be 
considered on a case-by-case basis. 
 
8. Contact directly with the ECPR Receiving Center Base facilitates clear communication and 
reduces delays. MICNs and Base physicians should be familiar with the differences in the field 
management priorities for these patients.  
 
9. In general, patients for whom contact is made with a non-E CPR SRC Base for medical direction 
should not be redirected to an ECPR Receiving Center, since the delay will result in poor ECPR 
candidacy; in such cases, medical direction should focus on optimizing the resuscitation to 
achieve ROSC. 
 
10. When the ECPR Receiving Center is the closest accessible SRC, additional patients who do not 
meet the ECPR criteria for immediate transport may be considered for ECPR on a case-by-case 
basis if the ECMO team feels the patient could benefit. Early contact with the ECPR SRC Base 
should be made in these cases to determine if early transport prior to ROSC is advisable.

GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Paramedics shall identify patients who meet ECPR criteria and manage the patient per TP 1210, 
Cardiac Arrest while prioritizing transport.  
 
2. Scene time for ECPR eligible patients should be limited to â‰¤15 minutes.  
 
3. A maximum of 3 doses of epinephrine (total of 3mg) is indicated during the resuscitation. Push-
dose epinephrine is appropriate and should be administered after ROSC to prevent re-arrest 
when indicated. 
 
4. An advanced airway should be inserted as soon as feasible to facilitate ventilations during 
transport. 
 
5. Communication with the ECPR Receiving Center Base should occur immediately after transport 
is initiated. Base will ensure the hospital is prepared to receive the patient and can activate the 
ECMO team.  
 
6. The ECPR Receiving Center Base will confirm priorities including chest compressions via MCD, 
defibrillations, and advanced airway with capnography monitoring, and will activate the ECMO 
team when indicated prior to patient arrival.
