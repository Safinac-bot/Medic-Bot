SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    For patients requiring transport to a Trauma Center per Ref. 506, contact the receiving Trauma 
Center for Base Medical Direction and notification. If the Base Hospital is contacted and the Base 
redirects transport to a Trauma Center, Base personnel will notify the Trauma Center.   
 
❷  Transport should be prioritized over advanced airway placement unless BMV is ineffective. Advanced 
airway may be placed during transport; supraglottic airway is preferred unless contraindicated. 
Paramedics should use judgment based on patient characteristics, circumstances, and skill level 
when selecting the advanced airway modality. 
 
❸     A backboard is not required for spinal motion restriction (SMR) and may cause harm as well as 
increased pain. Patients should not be transported on a backboard for the purpose of SMR. If a 
backboard is used for extrication, patients who are alert should then be logrolled onto the gurney 
prior to transport. The backboard may be used during patient transport for splinting of multiple 
simultaneous extremity fractures or to assist in maneuvering the unconscious patient. In all cases, 
the backboard should be removed immediately if causing respiratory compromise.   
 
❹  Traumatic events may be due to a medical emergency, particularly single-vehicle accidents and 
unexplained falls. 
 
❺    Placement of a vented dressing can prevent conversion of an open pneumothorax to a tension 
pneumothorax. However, tension pneumothorax may still develop in the presence of a vented 
dressing and should be treated with needle thoracostomy. Furthermore, needle thoracostomy in a 
patient with evidence of tension pneumothorax should not be delayed for placement of dressing. 
 
❻    Aggressive fluid resuscitation increases vascular pressure and dilutes clotting factors, which may 
increase internal bleeding.   
• In patients with blunt trauma and poor perfusion: administer fluids to target SBP ≥ 90mmHg.  
• In patients with penetrating trauma and poor perfusion: administer fluids to target SBP ≥ 70mmHg if 
patient has normal mental status (permissive hypotension).  Patients with ALOC or SBP < 
70mmHg should receive fluids until their mental status and SBP improve.   
• In patients with possible traumatic brain injury: permissive hypotension is contraindicated and SBP 
should be maintained ≥ 90mmHg. 
 
❼   In patients meeting an indication for TXA, administer fluid resuscitation with normal saline and TXA  
     concurrently. 
 
  ❽  Vomiting should be prevented and/or immediately treated in patients with head injury, since it 
increases intra-cranial pressure and can compromise the patient’s airway. 
 
❾   Traumatic brain injury presents with altered mental status after head injury.  Any hypoxic episode, 
even brief, is associated with worse patient outcome for patients with traumatic brain injury. 
 
❿ Hyperventilation reduces blood flow to the brain by reducing CO
2
 and is associated with worse 
outcomes in severe head injuries. Ventilate to maintain an ETCO
2
 in the range 35-45mmHg.  
 
⓫    Any hypotension increases mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. Normal Saline should be 
initiated to maintain SBP ≥ 90mmHg at all times but can be withheld if the blood pressure is elevated.

⓬    A head-elevated position at about 30 degrees reduces intra-cranial pressure and improves 
respiratory status. Patients in a cervical collar may have their head elevated if there is no concern for 
thoracic or lumbar spine injury. Reverse Trendelenburg is another option for patients that cannot be 
seated. Patients who are hypotensive should be maintained supine unless airway compromise 
requires repositioning.   
 
⓭ Open femur fracture is not a contraindication to apply the traction splint. If the bone is protruding and 
there is gross contamination, wash with saline prior to applying the splint. 
 
⓮    If the amputated part is available, similar care should be taken to rinse off any gross debris, wrap the 
part with saline-moistened sterile gauze, seal in plastic and place indirectly on ice after wrapping; do 
not submerge in water or place directly on ice.  Transport the amputated part with the patient and 
leave it with hospital staff.
