APPROVED: ________________________   __________________________ 
  Director, EMS Agency   Medical Director, EMS Agency 
PURPOSE: To provide guidelines for the efficient management of multiple casualty incidents 
(MCI) through coordination between prehospital care personnel, receiving 
facilities, and the Medical Alert Center (MAC) to allow for maximum resource 
allocation, patient distribution, and to prevent unnecessary delays in patient care 
and transport. 
 
To provide guidelines for transition from a MCI response to a Mass Casualty 
Incident Management Response. 
 
This policy defines the roles of the provider agency, MAC, base hospital, and 
receiving facilities during an MCI. 
 
DEFINITIONS : Refer to Ref. No. 519.1, Multiple Casualty Incidents (MCI) – Definitions. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. The Incident Command System (ICS) should be utilized at all MCI’s. 
 
2. Terminology is standardized. 
 
3. Expedient and accurate documentation is essential. 
 
4. The MAC is equipped to communicate with multiple receiving facilities simultaneously 
and can rapidly assess system wide emergency department bed status, hospital, and 
ambulance resources. 
 
5. Request for hospital diversion status should be considered when determining patient 
destination; however, if appropriate, patients may be directed to hospitals  requesting 
diversion (Exception: Internal Disaster). 
 
6. Patients requiring Advanced Life Support (ALS) treatment or procedures should be 
transported by paramedics whenever possible; however, these patients may be 
transported by Basic Life Support (BLS) units based on available resources during the 
MCI. BLS units may transport to other than the Most Accessible Receiving (MAR) facility 
if the patient meets specialty care center criteria and based on available system 
resources. 
 
7. The EMS Agency will facilitate a post-incident debriefing of large scale incidents to 
include all affected agencies. 
 
8. To maintain system readiness, provider agencies, hospitals, MAC, and other disaster 
response teams should carry out regularly scheduled MCI, disaster drills, and monthly 
VMED28 radio checks.

9. On any MCI in which the need for air transport is identified, early notification to air 
operations providers is essential in order to ensure rapid access to medical care and 
preserve life.  Air transport should be reserved for immediate patients whose transport 
destination is greater than can be achieved quickly by available ground ambulances. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Role of the Provider Agency 
 
A. Institute ICS as necessary. 
 
B. Implement MCI Triage Guidelines (modified START & Jump START) as 
necessary (see Ref. No. 519.2, MCI Triage Guidelines). 
 
C. Establish early communication with the: 
 
1. MAC, to support incident management;   
 
2. Base hospital, if indicated and feasible, for the purpose of medical 
direction and/or patient destination.  
 
3.  The transporting paramedic should make every attempt to notify the 
receiving facility if time permits.  With the dynamic situation of an MCI, 
this may not be feasible. 
 
D. If the need for additional ALS and/or BLS transport units exceeds the 
jurisdictional provider agency’s capability, additional transport resources may be 
requested by the jurisdictional dispatch center or the Fire Operational Area 
Coordinator (FOAC) as per Ref. No. 519.3, Multiple Casualty Incident 
Transportation Management. 
 
E. Request hospital based medical resources (i.e., HERT) from the MAC as outlined 
in Ref. No. 817, Regional Mobile Response Team if necessary. 
 
F. Provide the following scene information to the MAC: 
 
1. Nature of incident 
 
2. Location of incident  
 
3. Medical Communications Coordinator (Med Com) provider unit and 
agency 
 
4. Agency in charge of incident 
 
5. Total number of estimated immediate, delayed, minor and deceased 
patients. If indicated, include total number and category of pediatric 
patients 
 
6. Nearest receiving facilities including trauma centers, PMCs, PTCs, and

EDAPs 
 
7. Transporting provider, unit number, and destination 
 
8. Type of hazardous material, contamination, level of decontamination 
completed, if indicated 
 
9. Name of law enforcement agency on scene if involved in patient care 
and/or transportation 
 
G. Document the following patient information on the appropriate Patient Care 
Record: 
 
1. Patient name 
 
2. Chief complaint 
 
3. Triage category 
 
4. Mechanism of injury 
 
5. Age 
 
6. Sex 
 
7. Brief patient assessment 
 
8. Brief description of treatment provided 
 
9. Sequence number 
 
10. Transporting provider, unit number, and destination 
 
H. Reassess situational status to identify available resources and resource needs. If 
the anticipated resource needs exceed available local and mutual aid resources, 
contact the FOAC. Additional resources beyond the operational area shall be 
requested through the Regional Disaster Medical and Health Coordinator 
(RDMHC) via the MAC. 
 
C. Whenever departmental resources allow, the EMS provider agency should 
consider assigning a provider agency representative to report to the MAC to 
assist with communications and coordination of patient destination. 
 
II. Role of the MAC 
 
A. Provide prehospital care personnel with emergency department bed availability 
and diversion status as indicated by the ReddiNet poll. 
 
B. Arrange for additional ambulance transport units as requested by the FOAC or 
RDMHC.

C. Coordinate activation of Regional Mobile Response Teams as requested. 
 
D. Coordinate Air ambulance resources. 
 
E. Notify receiving facilities of incoming patients immediately via the ReddiNet®.

(MHOAC) for the County of Los Angeles, will assess the situational status and 
evaluate available resources and resource needs. If the anticipated resource 
needs exceed the available resources the EMS Agency, via its role as the 
RDMHC, will request resources from surrounding counties. 
 
K.   Maintain an EMS provider agency Medical/Health Resource Directory and assist  
 EMS providers with MCI resource management when requested.

(adult and pediatric) from MCIs, if needed MAC will distribute patients 
systemwide based on the incident. 
 
C.  When activated by the EMS Agency, Burn Resource Centers (BRC) can accept 
 up to 20 critically burned patients (includes both adult and pediatric). 
 
D.  Accept MCI patients as directed by the MAC or base hospital.

E. Monitor VMED 28 and ReddiNet®, recognizing that these are the default  
methods for MCI communications since Base Contact and/or notification may not 
be feasible when field resources are limited.  
 
F. Provide the MAC or base hospital with patient disposition information, sequence 
numbers, and/or triage tags when requested and enter information into the 
ReddiNet®. 
 
G. Maintain the “Receiving Facility” copy of the Patient Care Record and/or triage 
tag as part of the patient’s medical record. 
 
H. Ensure that requested patient information is entered as soon as possible into the 
ReddiNet® “MCI victim list” for all patients received from the MCI. The “MCI 
victim list” will remain open for 72 hours after the incident. 
 
I. Notify the MAC if resource needs exceed available resources.
