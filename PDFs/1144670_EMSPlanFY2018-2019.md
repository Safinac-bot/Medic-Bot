Los Angeles County – Department of Health Services 
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES 
ANNUAL UPDATE 2020 
(Fiscal Year 2018-2019) 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.254, requires the Emergency Medical 
Services (EMS) Agency to submit an EMS Plan to the State EMS Authority and follow it with 
annual updates thereafter.  Attached is the Los Angeles County FY 2018-2019 Annual 
Update which provides the required information on the status of our system and the EMS 
Agency's progress toward meeting long-range goals.   
 
 
Communications: 
 
The EMS Agency continues to be an active participant and voting member of the governing 
body of the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS) Board 
of Directors.  LA-RICS’ mission is to provide the finest mission-critical communication 
system with unwavering focus on the needs of the public safety professional. It is being 
designed and built to serve law enforcement and fire service first responders, along with 
health service professionals throughout Los Angeles County. 
 
With over 80 public safety agencies with approximately 34,000 first-responders, and 
encompassing a sprawling terrain of over 4,060 square miles that approximately 10 million 
people call home, the Los Angeles region seeks a modern interoperable public safety 
broadband network that allows multiple agencies to respond to the widest possible variety 
of emergencies. The LA-RICS Authority (JPA) is proposing to deploy a 700 MHz public 
safety mobile broadband network across all of Los Angeles County, featuri   ng almost 300 
wireless 700 MHz public safety broadband sites utilizing new and existing infrastructure, 
fixed microwave backhaul rings, and 100-miles of high-capacity fiber backbone.  The 
network would enable computer-aided dispatch, rapid law-enforcement queries, real-time 
video streaming, medical telemetry, patient tracking, geographic information systems 
services for first responders, and many other broadband-specific applications. 
LA-RICS is partnered with AT&T/First-Net, a nationwide first responder network authority to 
ensure coordination with the broadband network on a national level for public safety and 
first responders. 
 
Data: 
 
Efforts to incorporate the STEMI and stroke databases into a combined database with the 
three (3) core EMS Agency databases (EMS, base hospital, and trauma center) continue.  
To further enhance reporting and access capability, the EMS Agency continues to explore 
opportunities to improve TEMIS, such as a web-based solution. 
 
Of the ~700,000 EMS responses in the County, 100% of patient care records from public 
EMS providers are now collected through an electronic patient care report (ePCR).

NEMSIS COMPLIANT (78% of system data) 
Los Angeles County Fire District – (46% of system data) utilized STRYKER through June 
29, 2020 and converted to Image Trend’s ePCR platform on June 30, 2020. 
City of Los Angeles Fire Department – (3 1% of system data) utilizes STRYKER 
Cities of Torrance and Redondo Beach Fire Departments   (2% of system data) – utilizes 
W.A.  T.E.R. 
 
NON NEMSIS COMPLIANT (21% of system data) 
The remaining 26 fire departments are utilizing DIGITAL EMS 
 
DIGITAL EMS is in the process of becoming NEMSIS complaint.  Because of the work 
involved we expect completion in FY 2020-2021. 
 
The EMS Agency is in the process of finalizing an export that will allow for the submission of 
EMS data to the EMSA, the anticipated completion date is in  
October 2020. 
 
Sidewalk CPR: 
 
The EMS Agency Sidewalk CPR annual program is held during National CPR and AED 
Awareness Week. On June 1, 2017, in collaboration with the American Heart Association 
and community partners, over 5,000 citizens received training on “hands-only” 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This is a system-wide community effort with many of 
the fire departments, hospitals, and ambulance companies providing valuable public 
education in this life-saving technique to improve bystander CPR response for victims of 
sudden cardiac arrest.   
 
Exclusive Operating Areas (EOA) for 9-1-1 transportation:

EMS System Data Report: 
 
Our 7
th
 issue of the annual EMS System Data Report was presented in December, 2018.  
The goals of the system-wide data report include:

and to properly evaluate the quality of patient care provided. 
•    Demonstrate how the EMS system design parallels the healthcare needs of the 
community in addressing the leading causes of death and disability (heart attack, 
stroke, and trauma) as reported by Public Health. 
A copy of the EMS System Data Report is included in the documents submitted with this 
annual update. 
 
Los Angeles County Disaster Health Care Coalition (HCC): 
 
The HCC was established in October 2013 to coordinate strategic planning activities 
amongst healthcare facilities in various healthcare delivery sectors, public health agencies, 
other government entities and community partners to prepare for, respond to, and recover 
from emergencies and other incidents that impact the public’s health. 
 
LA County’s HCC has an advisory committee with representatives from acute care 
hospitals, community health centers, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers, ambulatory 
surgery centers, home health/hospice agencies, EMS providers, volunteer organizations, 
and government agencies that support Emergency Support Function 8 (ESF 8)  functions.  
The advisory committee is co-chaired by the LA County EMS Agency and Department of 
Public Health and meets three times per year to facilitate:

CHANGES TO DESTINATION POLICIES 
 
The City of Los Angeles Fire Department was approved to participate in the OSHPD pilot 
project to transport patients   meeting specific criteria to Sobering and Psychiatric Urgent Care 
Centers designated by the LEMSA.  As part of this process the EMS Agency has added these 
centers to our Resource Directory - facilities list included.    The EMS Agency will be moving 
forward to add these centers to our patient destination policy and develop criteria, protocols, 
monitoring, and quality improvement for this program.  Draft copies of the policies and proposed 
training curriculum are attached. As this program is developed, all protocols, policies, 
monitoring, and quality improvement plans will go through our committee process and submitted 
to our EMS Commission for approval and/or recommendations.  Our goal is to continue with the 
City of Los Angeles Fire Department’s program, and then bring new departments on board once 
they meet all of the criteria for education and monitoring.  The use of Sobering and Psychiatric 
Centers as destinations will be limited by the number and location of the designated centers. 

This is the last report of the decade!  
We are pleased to present the 2019 Emergency Medi-
cal  Services  (EMS)  System  data  report.  This  compre-
hensive  report  provides  the  data  for  our  EMS  system  
that  demonstrates  the  breadth  and  quality  of  our  pre-
hospital  care  to  the  public.  This  report  informs  our  
stakeholders  about  the  care  from  the  prehospital  set-
ting   to   the   emergency   de-
partment.  As  one  of  the  larg-
est  EMS  systems  in  the  Unit-
ed States we work collabora-
tively   with   our   prehospital,   
emergency     medicine     and     
inpatient   providers   to   inte-
grate  all  settings  of  care  for  
outcome optimization.  
The  EMS  Agency  and  provid-
ers  have  done  a  lot  of  work  
related  to  data  from  2010  -
19. The initiation of electron-
ic  data  capturing  in  the  field  
has    been    a    tremendous    
effort  for  the  providers,  ven-
dors,  and  the  agency  staff.  
The   addition   of   electronic   
data  capturing  has  allowed  us  to  be  more  nimble  and  
accurate  with  our  data  reporting  and  system  monitor-
ing.  Though,  not  easy,  it  has  created  great  opportuni-
ties for our system. 
We  have  successfully  implemented  Provider  Impres-
sion which empowers the EMS professionals to provide 
specific  prehospital  care  based  on  our  protocols.  In  
response  to  this  change  from  a  chief  complaint-based  
system  of  care  to  a  Provider  Impression  based  care,  
we  are  able  to  better  define  patient  needs,  provide  
more specific care, and evaluate that care in our quali-
ty improvement plan for the county.   
Our  Trauma  system  has  been  in  effect  for  over  35  
years   and   provides   needed   trauma   care   to   over   
22,000  trauma  patients  per  year.  This  report  outlines  
mechanism of injury and identifies falls as the leading 
mechanism of injury in our county. These data provide 
the  basis  of  local  and  regional  injury  prevention  pro-
grams. 
Our  ST  elevation  myocardial  infraction  (heart  attack)  
centers  continue  to  provide  rapid  treatment  of  heart  
attack  and  also  serve  as  cardiac  arrest  centers  where  
patients   receive   post   resuscitation   care.   We   have   
worked collaboratively with public health to increase train-
ing  in  hands  only  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  
which has led to an increase  in  bystander  CPR  rates  12%  
to  31%.  We  have  also  seen  a  continued  increase  in  our  
return  of  spontaneous  circulation  (ROSC)  rates  from  14%  
to  45%  in  2018.  What  an  achievement for  all  our  EMS  
providers and our system.  
In 2017, 2018 and 2019 the EMS Agency and fire depart-
ment  partners  received  the  American  Heart  Association  
Mission Lifeline GOLD award for data submission. This is a 
huge  achievement  for  our  system  and  offers  a  vision  for  
our  future  collaborations  that  will  improve  patient  care  
and outcome. 
In  2018  we  implemented  a  two-tier  stroke  system  that  
designates  both  Primary  and  Comprehensive  stroke  cen-
ters.  This  expansion  of  compre-
hensive  services  allows  for  pa-
tients  to  be  identified  by  para-
medics that have severe strokes 
and   then   transported   to   the   
Comprehensive    stroke    center    
which  has  the  ability  to  rapidly  
treat   the   stroke   by   emergent   
removal  of  offending  blood  clots  
in  the  circulation  of  the  brain.  
This  change  in  our  system  has  
resulted in greater access of this 
important   therapy   for   patients   
as well as improved outcomes. 
In   2019,   our   Stroke   System   
received  an  award  from  the  Los  
Angeles  County  Productivity  and  
Quality Commission, recognizing 
Innovative  Ideas.  In  addition,  our  data  is  being  used  to  
critically  analyze  our  EMS  system  performance.  On  the  
national level, data has helped us to set the standards for 
other systems. 
Throughout this report, the data show that we are meeting 
basic standards for care, particularly in time performance, 
such as field time, time to EKG, to specialty center and to 
critical  intervention.  The  next  decade,  2020,  we  will  be  
pushing  to  not  just  meet  performance  standards  but  to  
exceed them when appropriate and in the best interest of 
the patient. 
Many thanks to our EMS Agency data staff and the leader-
ship  and  talent  of  Richard  Tadeo,  Assistant  Director,  for  
not only their work on this report but for the daily efforts in 
managing and ensure the data quality for the system.

CriƟcal—a paƟent presents an acute injury or illness that could result in permanent damage, injury or death (head injury, vehicular accident, shooƟng). Applicable  
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for this level of service would be 99284 (detailed history, detailed physical, and medical decision making of moderate 
complexity) or 99285 (medical decision making of high complexity) or 99291 (criƟcal care, evaluaƟon and management). 
Urgent—a  paƟent  with an acute injury or illness, loss of life or limb is not an immediate threat to their well‐being, or a paƟent who needs Ɵmely evaluaƟon (fracture or 
laceraƟon). Applicable CPT codes for this level of service would be 99282 (medical decision making of low complexity) or 99283 (medical decision making of moderate 
complexity). 
Non‐Urgent—a paƟent with a non‐emergent injury, illness or condiƟon; someƟmes chronic; that can be treated in a non‐emergency seƫng and not necessarily on the 
same  day  they  are  seen  in  the  ED  (pregnancy  tests,  toothache,  minor  cold,  ingrown  toenail).  An  applicable  CPT  code  for  this  level  of  service  would  be  99281  (straight  
forward medical decision making).

Injury Severity Score by Mechanism of Injury 
Injury Severity Score (ISS): Is an established medical score to assess trauma severity. It correlates with 
mortality, morbidity and hospitalization time after trauma. It is used to define the term major trauma. 
A major trauma (or polytrauma) is defined as the ISS being greater than 15.

2.04 Dispatch 
Training 
Public safety answering 
point (PSAP) operators 
with medical responsibility 
shall have emergency 
medicine orientation and 
all medical dispatch 
personnel (both public and 
private) shall receive 
emergency medical 
dispatch training in 
accordance with the EMS 
Authority's Emergency 
Medical Dispatch 
Guidelines. 
 
RECOMMENDED 
GUIDELINES:   
Public safety answering 
point PSAP operators with 
medical dispatch 
responsibilities and all 
medical dispatch 
personnel (both public and 
private) should be trained 
and tested in accordance 
with the EMS Authority's 
Emergency Medical 
Dispatch Guidelines. 
 X  Approximately 95% of the Fire 
Departments providing Emergency 
Medical Services are dispatched by Fire 
Dispatch and provide pre-arrival 
instructions.  9-1-1 calls are routinely 
transferred from the PSAP to Fire 
Dispatch.   
 
The LEMSA has policies in place for 
dispatching of Emergency Medical 
Services.  The EMS Agency developed 
a “Template" pre-arrival instructions 
covering many of the medical, trauma, 
and environmental chief complaints.  
These templates were developed 
through a collaborative effort with 
representation from the twelve (12) 9-1-
1 dispatch centers in Los Angeles 
County.  These templates were cross 
referenced with each dispatch centers 
individual protocols to ensure that the 
most up-to-date pre-arrival instructions 
are being provided.  
Transition the 
one Fire 
Department 
utilizing police 
dispatch to 
either approved 
pre-arrival 
instructions or 
transition to a 
fire based 
dispatch center 
with existing 
pre-arrival 
instructions. 
 
The LEMSA 
plans on 
routinely (semi-
annually at a 
minimum) 
meeting with the 
9-1-1 
dispatching 
centers.

monitor 
compliance with 
mandated 
policies and 
standards 
3.01 
Communications 
Plan 
The local EMS agency 
shall plan for EMS 
communications.  The 
plan shall specify the 
medical communications 
capabilities of emergency 
medical transport 
vehicles, non-transporting 
advanced life support 
responders, and acute 
care facilities and shall 
coordinate the use of 
frequencies with other 
users. 
 
RECOMMENDED 
GUIDELINES:  The local 
EMS agency's 
communication plan 
should consider the 
availability and use of 
satellites and cellular 
telephones. 
X   CURRENT STATUS:   
21 Base Stations and 52 paramedic 
provider agencies, which account for 
nearly 600 paramedic units, have 
access to 9 medical channels.  Medical 
channels are assigned to the hospital 
base station.  Communication 
assignments have been developed and 
implemented.  Hospital base stations 
are assigned a primary channel and, in 
most cases, a backup frequency. 
 
LEMSA communication standards 
require 90% coverage, 90% of the time.  
The standard is maintained by the 
installation of local base stations at the 
hospital site and remote base stations 
at strategically placed sites to overcome 
communication problems caused by 
terrain.  LEMSA has installed and 
maintains 11 remote base stations on 
the mainland and 3 remote base 
stations on Catalina Island.

Progress Objective 
 
V-MED 28 radio frequencies replaced 
our previously used Hospital 
Emergency Administrative Radio 
(HEAR).  This frequency is installed in 
nearly 100% of all ALS vehicles 
(combination transport and non-
transport) and 75% of the BLS vehicles, 
the majority of which are privately 
owned ambulances which respond as a 
secondary transporter.   
 
100% of the healthcare facilities 
(hospitals) have V-MED28. 
 
The Rapid Emergency Digital Data 
Interface Network (ReddiNet) is 
installed in 100% of the acute care 
hospitals (9-1-1 Receiving hospitals), 
over 100 community clinics, and 44 
long-term care facilities.  The terminal is 
also installed at the Operations Control 
Division for Los Angeles City Fire 
Department, allowing access to all of 
their ALS field units.  Los Angeles 
County has upgraded ReddiNet from a 
microwave format to an internet-based 
system which has greatly improved 
system access. 
 
The County Wide Integrated Radio 
System (CWIRS) is installed at all Los 
Angeles County hospitals, 
comprehensive health centers, and 
ambulatory care centers.

Progress Objective 
Cellular telephone communication and 
radio are the pri   mary communications 
tools utilized by field personnel to make 
base station contact. 
 
Currently, the LEMSA is an active 
participant, and voting member of the 
governing body of the Los Angeles 
Regional Interoperable Communication 
System (LA-RICS) Board of Directors.  
LA-RICS’ mission is to provide the 
finest mission-critical communication 
system with unwavering focus on the 
needs of the public safety professionals, 
designed and built to serve law 
enforcement, fire services, and health 
services professionals (1
st
 responders) 
throughout Los Angeles County.  LA-
RICS completed the design and is 
currently in the installation process. 
 
COORDINATION WITH OTHER EMS 
AGENCIES: 
Los Angeles County is a subscriber in 
the Medical Interoperability Channel 
(155.340 MHz) which is designed to 
provide communications for mutual aid 
in the event of a large casualty 
producing event.  Secondary V-MED 28 
frequency (155.2 letters and 80MHz) is 
exclusively by Orange County is 
monitored and available for coordination 
with Orange County.

I. Introduction 
 
 
Los Angeles County EMS Agency Mission Statement  
 
 
 
 
To advance the health of our communities by ensuring 
quality emergency and disaster medical services  
 
 
The Los Angeles County (LAC) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency is 
responsible for monitoring and implementing regulatory oversight over for one of the 
largest multijurisdictional EMS systems in the nation. The LAC system utilizes more 
than 18,000 certified EMS personnel employed by public and private organizations,  
fire departments, ambulance companies, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies to 
provide emergency and non-emergency prehospital care to over 10 million residents 
and visitors.  
 
LAC requires a comprehensive quality improvement (QI) program to provide ongoing 
system evaluation to maintain quality in day-to-day operations while implementing 
process improvement strategies to advance patient care delivery that are consistent 
with best practices and evidence-based medicine. The QI plan provides the written 
framework for the QI program.  
 
Our system utilizes a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to drive improvement.  
It is educational, not punitive by design to encourage the exchange of information to 
enhance patient safety and minimize adverse events. Quality patient care delivery is 
sustained through ongoing evaluation, timely system feedback and education, in 
addition to, providing opportunities to acknowledge performance excellence within  
the system.   
 
The EMS Agency and QI program supports   the California EMS Authority (EMSA) in  
the development, implementation, and reporting of statewide core measures.  
 
The LAC EMS QI plan is written in accordance with the California Code of Regulations, 
Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 12: Emergency Medical Services System Quality 
Improvement and is consistent with the State of California Emergency Medical 
Services System Quality Improvement Program Model Guidelines and EMSA 166, 
Appendix E,  EMS Core Quality Measures.

III. Data Management 
 
A. Data Collection 
 
The EMS Agency obtains information through a variety of methods that include 
the following sources: electronic data exchange, hard copy review, internal and 
external customer surveys, and program reviews (audits). Data collection is 
primarily conducted via the Trauma and Emergency Medicine Information 
System (TEMIS), Lancet Technology Innovative Data Solutions by ESO. The 
TEMIS database assists   the EMS Agency in evaluating, monitoring, and 
coordinating all EMS system components, as well as meet state data collection 
requirements. 
 
All public 9-1-1 and Exclusive Operating Area provider agencies utilize an 
electronic patient care record (ePCR) platform. Private (non-9-1-1) provider 
agencies, paramedic base hospitals and trauma centers utilizing paper PCR 
capture the required data elements using an approved electronic platform and 
standard paper forms (EMS Report Form, Base Hospital Form and Trauma 
Patient Summary Form).  All paramedic base hospitals and trauma centers 
conduct data entry on site. The data is uploaded automatically to a dedicated 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site every 24 hours.   
 
Other mechanisms by which the EMS Agency obtains data include direct data 
input to the LA STEMI and LA Stroke databases by the designated SRC and 
stroke hospitals.  Stroke data is also downloaded from the Get With The 
Guidelines (GWTG) Patient Management Tool. Helicopter EMS (HEMS) data is 
submitted to the EMS Agency on a quarterly basis from the three HEMS 
providers in LA County.  The EMS Agency continues to work on the process of 
incorporating the STEMI, Stroke and HEMS data into TEMIS. Systemwide data 
collection on hospital diversion, bed availability, and surge capacity are 
collected via ReddiNet.

2019/20 
 
 
 
The Public Safety Agency Data Registry allows   public safety agencies approved 
for naloxone administration to enter data directly into the data registry. Each 
public safety agency may utilize the data registry to generate reports on their 
own agency to assist in the quality improvement process required  
for program approval. The EMS Agency oversees the data and will  
provide aggregate system reports.   
 
B. Data Validation 
 
Data submitted to the EMS Agency databases undergoes an extensive data 
quality review and clean up through the following mechanisms: 
 
1.  EMS Agency data entry personnel conduct monthly peer review data 
audits. Identified errors are corrected and overall data entry performance 
is included in the data entry personnel’s periodic performance evaluation 
report. 
 
2.  EMS provider agencies utilizing electronic data collection are required to 
validate their data using the EMS Agency’s published EMS Data 
Validator before submission to the FTP site. The EMS Agency conducts 
a secondary validation before final upload to TEMIS. Data that fails 
validation is rejected and sent back to the EMS Provider for correction. 
 
3.  Annual data audits are conducted by the EMS Agency for each EMS 
Provider Agency. A corrective action plan is required for data elements 
that fall below a 90% compliance rate for accuracy and completeness.  
 
4.  Data clean up reports are generated by the EMS Agency on a quarterly 
basis for Paramedic Base Hospitals and Trauma Centers. In general, a 
corrective action plan is required for data elements that fall below a 90% 
compliance rate for accuracy and completeness. 
 
5.  Documentation reports are routinely developed and disseminated in the 
quality improvement committees for evaluation and education on the 
application of the data dictionary and data standards to improve 
reliability.   
 
C.  Data Submission 
 
1.  The EMS Agency ensures timely data collection and submission from 
base and trauma hospitals through written agreements.   
 
2.  Data collection requirements for other specialty care centers are 
prescribed in the specific specialty care center Standards and local 
policies.   
 

Los Angeles County  
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2019/20 Quality Improvement Plan 
Page 9 of 17 
2019/20 
 
3.  EMS provider agency data collection requirements are governed by local 
policies. Submission of required data to the EMS Agency is    highly 
dependent upon organizational resources (method of data collection/  
 
ePCR vendor) and size (personnel/volume of EMS responses). The EMS 
Agency has established policies and procedures specific to submission of 
electronic patient care data. However, provider agencies experience 
vendor-related problems that cause significant delays in data submission 
to the EMS Agency. The EMS Agency and EMS community continue to 
work together on improving data collection and submission as the system 
transitions to the CEMSIS data requirements.  
 
4.  The LA County Trauma Center Programs   participate in the American 
College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) and 
are members of the LA County TQIP Collaborative. Collaborative system-
level TQIP reports allow us to compare our system performance to 
national results and impart opportunities for system-wide QI projects.  
 
 
5.  EMS providers may be required to submit self-reported data utilizing 
Excel spreadsheets for the following reasons: 
 
a.  Non-911 (interfacility) transports   are not entered into TEMIS. 
 
b.  Base hospitals and public 911 provider agencies may be required 
to submit data on prospective QI projects when the required data 
cannot be accessed through the EMS Agency databases. 
 
c.   Provider agencies approved for a pilot project with an expanded 
local scope of practice requiring data not captured in the EMS 
Agency databases.  
 
d.  The EMS Agency is joining the Cardiac Arrest Registry to 
Enhance Survival (CARES) with data entry into CARES database 
beginning January 2021 for system benchmarking.  
 
D. Data Utilization  
 
1.  The EMS Agency utilizes the TEMIS, LA STEMI, LA Stroke, and GWTG 
databases for both statewide core measures and local system reports. 
The local reports are utilized for daily operations such as performance 
and contract monitoring, system audits, policy revision, and QI activities. 
The databases are also used to provide the information needed to  
analyze the potential impact of hospital diversions and closures.  
 
2.  Self-reported data utilizing Excel spreadsheets are utilized, when needed 
for private non-9-1-1 provider agency QI projects and evaluating 
performance and ensuring safety when new medications, treatment 
and/or devices are implemented into the system.  
 

Los Angeles County

2019/20 
 
3. Public Safety Data Registry was implemented in May 2020 and will 
initially be utilized to evaluate the utilization of naloxone administered by 
approved public safety agencies. The plan is to expand the data registry 
to collect additional data regarding other field care provided by public 
safety agencies (i.e., tourniquet application and AED).   
 
E. Limitations 
 
1.  Separate Databases: The existence of multiple databases is not  
ideal for timely reporting. Multiple data entry and data abstraction are 
conducted on the same patient.  Data analysis is resource-intensive 
when data elements are found in the various databases.  
 
 
2.  Multiple System Participants: Data validation and transmission is 
complex as more EMS provider agencies move toward utilizing various 
ePCR software applications. Changes to the reporting standards often 
require additional time and expense.   
 
3.  Data Quality: Current methods of data capture require extensive data  
 audits. Cleanup is needed to ensure valid and reliable data. 
 
4.  Data Use Agreement (DUA): Meaningful evaluation of system 
performance is highly dependent on the collaboration amongst the 
participants, consensus on how data will be collected and utilized. 
Currently, the EMS Agency is only able to share a limited dataset with the 
EMS Authority without a DUA in place. A DUA would allow for an open 
and full exchange of data that can be used to expand the evaluation of 
system performance and improve delivery of care.  
 
IV. Quality Indicators 
 
A. Utilization of Provider Impression/New Treatment Protocols   
The new adult and pediatric Treatment Protocols (TP) utilizing Provider Impression 
(PI) codes were implemented in 2018 with systemwide transition complete in April 
2019. The EMS Public 9-1-1 Provider Agency and Base Hospital QI Committee 
assist the EMS Agency in evaluating the transition. Reference 1373, Medical 
Control Guideline: Treatment Protocol Quality Improvement Fallout Data Dictionary 
is a comprehensive tool developed to assist with standardizing the QI process.    
Link to Ref. No. 1373, TP QI Fallout Data Dictionary
 
 
 
B. Ambulance Patient Offload Time (APOT)  
The EMS Agency continues to work with the system participants to collect data 
using the Standardize Methods for Collecting and Reporting APOT data adopted by 
the EMS Authority. A workgroup has been convened to assist the EMS Agency in 
policy development to provide guidance in reducing 911 patient offload time. 
Members include representatives from the following organizations: Hospital 
Association of Southern California, Los Angeles County Ambulance Association, 
Emergency Nurses Association, Los Angeles County Professional Fire Fighter’s 
union, public (9-1-1) and private (non-911) provider agencies, and base hospitals.

2019/20 
 
 
 
 
C. EMSA Core Quality Measures 
The EMS Agency historically has participated in statewide data submission to 
CEMSIS and continues   to actively participate in statewide data collection through 
the submission of core measure data outlined in EMSA #166, EMS Quality 
Improvement Program Guidelines/Core Quality Measures. To ensure reliable and 
valid data, the EMS Agency will continue to update our data dictionary and provide 
training/feedback to EMS personnel on documentation of the core measure data 
elements with the exception of ambulance response times by zones. The LAC EMS 
system is not designed to collect data by zones
. Alternatively, systemwide 
ambulance response times are collected and reported.  
 
 
D. COVID-19  
Early 2020 the EMS Agency implemented Reference No.1245, Potential COVID-19 
Patients and Reference No. 845, Treat and Refer for Mild Respiratory Illness 
During the COVID-19 Outbreak to guide treatment and transport decisions during 
the emerging pandemic. This required a change in our system performance 
indicators to evaluate the delivery of care for potential COVID-19 patients.. A 
dedicated webpage was established to enable timely access to current information 
on COVID-19 related hospital and prehospital data, PPE distribution, and 
educational resources. Additionally, the EMS Agency implemented weekly Zoom 
conference calls, led by the Medical Director, to provide the EMS community with 
information and updates on clinical and operational aspects that impact the delivery 
of prehospital care. Link to COVID Resources and Updates

Research provides an evidence base to support prehospital medical treatments and 
interventions. The EMS Agency actively supports prehospital research through the 
Research Data Collaboratives. Link to EMS System Publications  
 
VI. Evaluation of System Indicators 
 
 
A. The System EMS QI Coordinator and designated staff prepare reports on 
system performance indicators to be utilized by the QI Team, Advisory 
Committees, and EMS Commission to ensure systemwide evaluation. 
 
B. Under the direction of the EMS Agency Medical Director, the EMS Agency QI 
Team will analyze system reports generated by each EMS Agency section 
responsible for reporting on current performance indicators   and EMS Authority 
Core Measures. 
 
C. Presentations on performance indicators will be prepared in the most 
appropriate format to allow for ease of interpretation of data. Formats most 
commonly utilized include line charts, bar graphs, flowcharts, and data tables.

VII. Action to Improve  
 
A.   The EMS Agency, under the direction of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, utilizes the FOCUS PDSA model for performance improvement.  
 
 
1. Find a process to improve; improvement needs are identified by the EMS 
Agency QI Team in collaboration with the TAG, QI and Advisory groups. 
2. Organize the process utilizing the team most familiar with the process related to 
the system process identified.  
3. Clarify current knowledge of the process by collecting information and reviewing 
current trends. 
4. Understand capabilities and causes for variations in processes by utilizing 
brainstorming techniques and fishbone diagrams or flowcharts. 
5. Select a strategy or process for improvement that will most likely reduce or 
eliminate the causes for variation in performance. 
6. Plan, determine objectives and develop plan in agreement with system 
participants. 
7. Do, carry out the action according to established plan.  
8. Study findings, the EMS QI Team with system input will analyze the findings, 
compare with hypothesis, and prepare a summary for a trend report.  
9. Act on findings, the EMS QI Team in collaboration with the TAG, QI and 
Advisory groups will determine performance improvement needs.  A Quality 
Task Force may be chartered if needed, to carry out specific performance 
improvement plans.  
 
 
VIII. Training and Education 
 
 
 
A. The effectiveness of the QI process is related to the efficacy of training and 
educational activities. Due the size and complexity of our system, training and 
education is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms:   
 
1. Quality Improvement Committees/Advisory Meetings 
Information needed for improving local system and statewide 
performance is disseminated to committee members for training and 
education of providers responsible for direct patient care.

2. EMS Update 
Under the direction of Dr. Denise Whitfield, the EMS Agency staff, 
Paramedic Training Institute, and system stakeholders develop and 
implement the mandatory annual EMS Update that address educational 
and training needs related to performance improvement. The EMS 
Update 2020 format was changed to an on-line format utilizing a learning 
management system.  
 
3. EMS Data Report  
The EMS Agency publishes an annual data report that provides valuable 
feedback to the EMS community and citizens of Los Angeles on system 
demographics and performance.  
Link to LAC EMS System Report 
 
4.   
 
The Emergi-Press is a web-based EMS educational forum located on the 
EMS Agency website. Educational material includes, ECG of the month 
video learning modules, and cases from the field that are posted monthly 
with availability to earn continuing education credit. Additionally, the 
Emergi-Press utilizes Updates from The Medical Director to communicate 
pertinent information to EMS personnel and stakeholders regarding 
system issues. Link to Emergi-Press, current and past
 
 
B. The EMS Agency QI Team and other advisory groups review policies and 
procedures to insure consistency with the EMSA and LAC EMS QI plan.   
 
C. Once a performance improvement plan has been successfully implemented, the 
EMS Agency will post all policies and system updates to its   website to allow 
timely access by all EMS participants.  
 
VIII. Update/Summary 
 The QI plan was updated to reflect the changes in our plan and performance 
measures. Year 2020 required the EMS Agency to focus efforts on evaluating COVID-
19 related Provider Impressions, utilization of Treatment Protocol Reference No. 1245, 
Potential COVID-19 Patient, Reference No.834, Patient Refusal of Treatment or 
Transport, and Reference No. 845, Treat and Refer for Mild Respiratory Illness During 
the COVID-19 Outbreak. An ad hoc committee with community partners was convened 
to evaluate the EMS Agency data and improve prehospital care for patients not 
transported. The QI plan is submitted to EMSA for review and published on the EMS 
Agency website for review by the EMS participants and system stakeholders.
