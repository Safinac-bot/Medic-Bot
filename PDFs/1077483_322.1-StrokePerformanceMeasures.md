minutes 50% of the time. 
 
IV. Tracking Measures 
 
A. Percentage of ischemic stroke patients with a large vessel cerebral occlusion 
(i.e., internal carotid artery (ICA) or ICA terminus (T-lesion; T-occlusion), middle 
cerebral artery (MCA) M1 or M2, basilar artery) who receive mechanical 
endovascular reperfusion (MER) therapy and who achieve TICI 2B or higher for 
the primary vessel occlusion < 60 minutes from the time of skin puncture.   
 
B. Percentage of ischemic stroke patients who develop a symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage (i.e., clinical deterioration > 4 point increase on National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and brain image findings of parenchymal 
hematoma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage) < 36 
hours after the onset of treatment with intravenous (IV) thrombolytic therapy 
only. 
 
C. Percentage of ischemic stroke patients who develop a symptomatic intracranial 
hemorrhage (i.e., clinical deterioration > 4 point increase on National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and brain image findings of parenchymal 
hematoma, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage) < 36 
hours after the onset of treatment with intra-arterial (IA) thrombolytic therapy or 
MER therapy. 
 
D. Percentage of ischemic stroke patients treated with intra-venous (IV) or intra-
arterial (IA) thrombolytic therapy or who undergo MER therapy and have a 
discharge modified Rankin Scale <of 2 or back to baseline. 
 
E. Percentage of confirmed stroke patients transported to your hospital by EMS and 
for whom <90 minutes was spent in the ED prior to transfer to a higher-level 
stroke center for time-critical therapy (e.g., MER)
