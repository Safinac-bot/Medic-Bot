SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶  Warming measures should include moving the patient to a warm environment as quickly as 
possible, removing wet clothing/items, covering with an emergency/rescue blanket or 
blanket/sheets, and using warm normal saline if available.  
 
❷ Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body 
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat. 
 
❸    Do not allow an area of frostbite to thaw and then refreeze as this causes more tissue damage. 
 
❹    Follow usual protocols for resuscitation of patients with hypothermic cardiac arrest while 
rewarming. Patients with hypothermia may have good neurologic outcome despite prolonged 
resuscitation; resuscitative efforts should continue until the patient is rewarmed. Consultation with 
the Base Physician is required before consideration of termination of resuscitation.
