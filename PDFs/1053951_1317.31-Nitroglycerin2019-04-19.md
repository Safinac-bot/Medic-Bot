REVISED: 07-01-24 PAGE 1 OF 1 
Classification 
 Nitrate Vasodilator 
 
LA County Prehospital Indications  
Chest Pain – Suspected Cardiac 
Chest Pain – STEMI 
Pulmonary Edema / CHF 
 
Other Common Indications (Not authorized for EMS administration in LA County) 
Rapid blood pressure lowering in hypertensive emergency 
 
Adult Dose 
Chest Pain – Suspected Cardiac / Chest Pain – STEMI 
0.4 mg SL prn, repeat every 5 min prn x2, total 3 doses, hold if SBP < 100mmHg or patient has 
taken sexually enhancing medication within 48 hours 
Pulmonary Edema / CHF 
0.4mg SL, for SBP ≥ 100mmHg 
0.8mg SL, for SBP ≥ 150mmHg 
1.2mg SL, for SBP ≥ 200mmHg 
Repeat every 3-5 min prn x2 for persistent dyspnea, assess blood pressure prior to each 
administration and determine subsequent dose base on SBP as listed above. Hold if SBP 
< 100mmHg 
Pediatric Dose 
Not recommended for pediatric administration 
 
Mechanism of Action 
Organic nitrate which causes systemic venous dilatation, decreasing preload. Cellular mechanism: nitrate 
enters vascular smooth muscle and is converted to nitric oxide leading to vasodilation. Relaxes smooth 
muscle via dose-dependent dilation of arterial and venous beds to reduce both preload and afterload, and 
myocardial oxygen demand. Also improves coronary collateral circulation. Lowers BP, increases heart rate 
and occasional paradoxical bradycardia. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is 1-3 min SL or TM; duration is 20-30 min 
 
Contraindications 
Use of sexually enhancing/erectile dysfunction medications such as sildenafil, tadalafil or vardenafil within 
the past 48 hours 
Hypotension with SBP < 100mmHg 
Suspected cardiac tamponade 
 
Interactions 
Alcohol, opiates and antihypertensive agents may compound hypotensive effects. Patients taking sexually 
enhancing/erectile dysfunction medications are at risk for severe, prolonged hypotension leading to death. 
 
Adverse Effects 
Circulatory Collapse 
Dizziness 
Headache 
Hypotension / Postural Hypotension 
Syncope 
Weakness 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Caution advised in suspected intracranial hemorrhage or stroke patients
