“Immediate” patients have the most life-threatening injuries/illness requiring priority transport and would 
receive the greatest benefit from time critical medical interventions and definitive care. 
 
2. Patients that meet Trauma Center Criteria (Ref. No. 506) should be transported to designated Trauma 
Centers whenever possible. 
 
3. Pediatric patients should be transported to designated Pediatric Trauma Centers (PTC), Pediatric 
Medical Centers (PMC) or Emergency Department Approved for Pediatrics (EDAP) as appropriate to 
their condition.
