PURPOSE: To outline the procedure for receiving hospitals and EMS providers to request 
diversion of advanced life support (ALS) and basic life support (BLS) patients. 
 
AUTHORITY: Health & Safety Code, Division 2.5, Sections, 1797.220 
  California Code of Regulations, Title 13, Section 1105 (c) 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
  
Advanced Life Support Patient (ALS): A patient who requires paramedic assessment and/or 
intervention listed in Ref. No. 803, Los Angeles County Paramedic Scope of Practice, this 
includes but not limited to patients meeting Base contact requirements outlined in Ref. No. 
1200, Treatment Protocols, et al. 
 
Basic Life Support Patient (BLS): A patient who only requires Emergency Medical Technician 
(EMT) assessment and/or intervention as listed in Ref. No. 802, Emergency Medical Technician 
(EMT) Scope of Practice. 
 
PRINCIPLE:  
 
1. A receiving hospital may request diversion of 9-1-1 ALS and/or BLS patients away from 
its emergency department (ED) when unable to care for additional patients due to 
inadequate staffing, equipment, and/or critical systems or infrastructure. 
 
2. An EMS provider agency may request diversion of 9-1-1 ALS and/or BLS patient away 
from an ED that is unable to assume care of the patient due to prolonged ambulance 
patient offload time as outlined in Ref. No. 503.1  
 
3. Base hospitals will honor diversion requests based on patient condition and available 
system resources. 
 
4. Hospital diversion data are used in EMS system analysis, and to formulate critical early 
indicators of syndrome-specific illness outbreaks within the County. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. In general, diversion requests shall be communicated through the ReddiNet system. 
 
II. Each hospital shall maintain a current diversion policy which requires the decision to 
request diversion be made jointly by representatives of the hospital’s administration, 
emergency department, specialty services, and nursing. The name and title of the 
authorizing hospital administrator or designee are required to complete the diversion 
request process.

III. EMS Agency staff may perform unannounced site visits to hospitals requesting diversion 
to ensure compliance with these guidelines. 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
A. Receiving hospitals are responsible for maintaining and updating ReddiNet diversion 
status to ensure that accurate information is available for patient destination decisions. 
Telephone communication is necessary when the ReddiNet system is not operational or 
when a hospital is requesting diversion due to ED BLS or internal disaster. The Medical 
Alert Center (MAC) shall be notified via telephone at (866) 940-4401. 
 
B. Diversion Request Categories 
 
1. ED Saturation (ED ALS, ED BLS, Provider ED) – ED resources (beds, equipment 
and/or staff are fully committed or are not sufficient to care for additional 
incoming ALS and/or BLS patients. The procedure for requesting diversion due 
to ED saturation shall be in accordance with Ref. No. 503.1, Diversion Request 
Requirements for Emergency Department Saturation. ED BLS Diversion requires 
approval by the EMS Agency Administrator On-Duty (AOD) via the Medical Alert 
Center. 
 
2. Computerized Tomography (CT) Scanner – Hospital is unable to provide 
essential diagnostic procedures due to lack of a functioning CT scanner. 
 
3. Trauma (trauma centers and pediatric trauma centers only) – Hospital is unable 
to care for additional trauma patients because the trauma team is fully committed 
caring for trauma patients. The rationale for a temporary diversion request shall 
be communicated via the ReddiNet system using the applicable reason code. 
Reason codes include the following: 
 
a. Critical Equipment Unavailable: Diversion may be requested when critical 
equipment essential to definitive diagnosis or treatment of trauma patients 
is unavailable. 
 
b. Operating Room (OR) Unavailable: Diversion may be requested when 
both the primary and the back-up ORs and staff are fully encumbered 
caring for trauma patients to the extent that the care of additional trauma 
patients may be jeopardized. 
 
c. Trauma Team Encumbered: Diversion may be requested when trauma 
resources, including the trauma surgeon, are fully encumbered to the 
extent that the care of additional trauma patients may be jeopardized. 
 
d. Other: For any other circumstances in which the trauma center may 
become temporarily unable to meet contractual requirements, to the 
extent that the care of certain trauma patients may be jeopardized, the 
trauma center shall contact the EMS Agency to request a waiver in 
advance of the diversion. If a waiver is granted, the hospital and the MAC 
will jointly ensure that affected base hospitals and EMS provider agencies 
are properly advised of the nature and extent of the waiver.

4. Pediatric Medical Center (PMC) – Diversion may be requested only when critical 
equipment essential to definitive diagnosis or treatment of critical medical 
pediatric patients is unavailable. Lack of available Pediatric Intensive Care Unit 
beds alone is not sufficient cause to request PMC diversion. 
 
5. ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) (STEMI receiving centers only) – 
Diversion may be requested only when all cardiac catheterization laboratories 
(cath labs) are fully encumbered caring for STEMI patients, to the extent that the 
care of additional STEMI patients may be jeopardized. ED saturation is not 
sufficient cause to request SRC Diversion. The SRC may request STEMI 
diversion under any of the following conditions: 
 
a. The SRC is unable to perform emergent percutaneous coronary 
intervention because the cardiac cath staff is already fully committed to 
caring for STEMI patients in the cath lab. STEMI patients should be 
transported to the most accessible open SRC regardless of ED diversion 
status. 
 
b. The SRC experiences critical mechanical failure of essential cath lab 
equipment. SRCs must notify the EMS Agency SRC System Program 
Manager directly at (562) 378-1652 as to the nature of the mechanical 
failure or equipment issue if the anticipated diversion is expected to 
exceed 24 hours. 
 
6. Stroke 
 
a. Primary Stroke Center (PSC): Diversion may be requested only when 
there is no means to perform diagnostic brain imaging – CT scan or MRI. 
The reason for diversion must be documented in ReddiNet. ED saturation 
is not sufficient cause to request PSC diversion. 
 
b. Comprehensive Stroke Center (CSC): Hospital is unable to care for 
additional stroke patients because the stroke team is fully committed 
caring for stroke patients. The rationale for a temporary diversion request 
shall be communicated via the ReddiNet system using the applicable 
reason code. Reason codes include the following: 
 
i. Critical Equipment Unavailable: Diversion may be requested when 
critical equipment essential to definitive diagnosis or treatment of 
stroke patients is unavailable. 
 
ii. Interventional Radiology (IR) Room Unavailable: Diversion may be 
requested when both the primary and back-up IRs and staff are 
fully encumbered caring for stroke patients to the extent that the 
care of additional stroke patients may be jeopardized. 
 
iii. Stroke Team Encumbered: Diversion may be requested when 
stroke resources, are fully encumbered to the extent that the car 
of additional stoke patients may be jeopardized.

7. Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) – Diversion may be 
requested when the hospital has no means to perform ECPR due to lack of 
available qualified personnel, lack of critical resources or no pumps. ED 
saturation is not sufficient cause to request ECPR diversion. ECPR diversion 
does not divert patients in cardiac arrest with the exception of patients meeting 
ECPR criteria for whom another ECPR receiving facility is available within the 30-
minute transport time. 
 
8. Internal Disaster – Diversion of both ALS and BLS patients may be requested 
when a facility disruption threatens the ED or significant patient care services, to 
the extent that care of additional patients may be jeopardized. 
 
a. A hospital requesting diversion due to internal disaster must notify the 
MAC by telephone and provide the name of the administrator authorizing 
the diversion and the rational for internal disaster. Appropriate rational 
include: 
 
i. Power outage impacting patient care, which cannot be sufficiently 
mitigated by emergency generators 
 
ii. Critical infrastructure or systems failure impacting patient care, 
which cannot be sufficiently mitigated by emergency back-up 
procedures 
 
iii. Fire 
 
iv. Bomb threat/explosion 
 
v. Flooding 
 
vi. Water disruption/contamination 
 
vii. Hazardous materials contamination of patient care areas 
 
viii. Other – Must be approved by the EMS Agency through the MAC 
or Health Facilities Inspection Division of the Department of Public 
Health. Internal Disaster does not apply to work actions. 
 
b. For situations in which a hospital knows in advance that it will need to 
divert to internal disaster, hospital shall notify the EMS Agency in writing, 
well in advance of the scheduled diversion. It is the responsibility of the 
hospital to notify area base hospital(s) and all affected EMS provider 
agencies. 
 
c. Upon request by the EMS Agency, a hospital shall submit an after-action 
report within 60 days of the incident when a hospital’s diversion due to 
internal disaster is greater than four (4) hours.
