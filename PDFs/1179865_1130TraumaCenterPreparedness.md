PURPOSE:  To establish minimum standards and provide guidelines for the development of 
a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan to enhance surge capacity at 
Trauma Centers (TC). 
 
AUTHORITY:  Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013, 
Section 319C-1 
Specialty Care Center Designation Exhibit for Hospital Preparedness 
Program Participant, Exhibit A-2.4 
 
DEFINITION: 
 
Surge Capacity:  The ability to quickly expand capacity and capability beyond normal 
operations to meet an increased demand for medical care in the event of a multiple casualty 
incident (MCI), bioterrorism, or other large-scale public health emergencies. 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. TCs have a significant role in the healthcare community’s response to terrorist incidents 
or natural disasters involving multiple casualties. 
 
2. TCs shall have a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan that includes all 
essential hospital departments to maximize surge capacity to receive up to 20 critical 
patients. 
 
3. Emergency preparedness plans shall be a scalable, all-hazards approach with emphasis 
on management of multiple casualties with traumatic injuries. 
 
4. Emergency preparedness plans shall provide for sustainability of the facility. 
 
5. Functional exercise shall be conducted annually. Corrective measures must be 
implemented in a timely manner to address deficiencies identified during the exercise. 
 
6. TCs shall adopt a Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) that is compliant with the 
National Incident Management System (NIMS) and integrate the NIMS Implementation 
Activities for Hospitals and Healthcare Systems. 
 
POLICY: 
 
TCs shall develop a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan that addresses the following 
critical elements incorporating guidance set forth in the “Los Angeles County Medical and 
Health Operational Area Coordination Program: Healthcare Surge Planning Guide and Los 
Angeles County Emergency Services Agency Communication Plan.”:

I. Triage – Develop a hospital triage system to identify patients needing intensive care or 
surgery and patients who can be downgraded from intensive care, transferred to other 
healthcare facilities, or discharged. 
 
II. Surge Beds – Pre-identify physical space for expansion of intensive care and non-critical 
services and establish procedures to expand bed capacity for intensive care and general 
medical-surgical patients. 
 
III. Personnel – Designate hospital personnel and establish procedures to manage the TC’s 
emergency response. 
 
A. Trauma Surge Coordinator – Responsible for the development, implementation, 
evaluation, and maintenance of all aspects of the TC Emergency Preparedness 
Plan. The Trauma Surge Coordinator shall participate in the overall emergency 
preparedness activities of the TC including but not limited to providing on-going 
trauma and burn surge training to personnel. 
 
B. Support staff – Enhance staffing by implementing surge strategies such as 
utilizing registry agencies, reassigning administrative clinical staff to clinical 
settings and accepting licensed professionals from volunteer agencies   
 
C. Develop and maintain decontamination capabilities consistent with the Specialty 
Care Center Designation Exhibit for Hospital Preparedness Program Participant. 
 
IV. Training – Conduct annual training on emergency preparedness for TC personnel and 
medical staff. Training shall include participation in a functional disaster exercises. 
 
V. Equipment and Supplies – Establish a process for procurement, storage, and 
management of the following trauma equipment and supplies sufficient to accommodate 
a surge: 
 
A. Monitoring equipment with EKG, oxygen saturation, and invasive and non-
invasive pressure monitoring capabilities 
 
B. Ventilators 
 
C. Portable ultrasound machine 
 
D. Point-of-Care analyzers 
 
E. Intravenous fluids and pumps 
 
F. Blood products and volume expanders 
 
G. Pharmaceuticals required for critically injured patients 
 
VI. Communications – TCs shall have secure and redundant communication systems that 
allow connectivity to other TCs, healthcare facilities, and emergency response agencies. 
Each TC must implement, maintain, update, and regularly test a staff mass notification 
system which incorporates a response group for trauma team activation.

VII. Patient Tracking - In conjunction with Los Angeles County’s regional patient tracking 
program, participate in the patient identification and family reunification plan. 
 
VIII. Security – Develop policies and procedures to secure the TC and manage the influx of 
victims, family members, and the press. These procedures will be implemented to 
prevent the obstruction of patient care delivery.
