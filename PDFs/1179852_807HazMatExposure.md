PURPOSE: To safely manage medical emergencies at a hazardous materials incident 
while preventing exposure to responders, minimizing exposure to victims 
through effective decontamination, and preventing or minimizing 
secondary contamination of transporting vehicles and receiving facilities. 
 
AUTHORITY: Health and Safety Code 1798 (a)  
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Decontamination: The process of removing, neutralizing or reducing contamination 
from personnel or equipment, preventing or minimizing the spread of contamination by 
persons and equipment. 
 
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) Response Team: An organized team of trained 
personnel who respond to a hazardous materials incident for the purpose of control and 
stabilization of the incident. This function is performed by the public fire service within 
Los Angeles County. 
 
Health Hazmat Response Unit: A response unit within the County of Los Angeles Fire 
Department responsible for public health issues related to hazardous materials releases. 
The cities of Pasadena, Vernon, and Long Beach respond their own Health Hazmat 
Response Unit within their respective jurisdictions. 
 
Medical Alert Center (MAC): Assists the provider agencies and base hospitals with 
patient destination decisions with multiple casualty incidents. It serves as the control 
point for VMED28 and ReddiNet® systems. 
 
Medical Communications Coordinator (Med Com): Establishes communications with 
the MAC or designated base hospital to obtain status of available hospital beds. The 
Med Com assigns appropriate patient destinations based on available resources. This 
position receives basic patient information and condition from Treatment Dispatch 
Manager and provides the MAC or base hospital with information on the assigned 
patient destinations and transporting ambulance unit. 
 
Poison Control Center: A facility designated by the Emergency Medical Services Authority 
that provides information and advice to the public and health professionals regarding the 
management of patients who have or may have ingested, inhaled or otherwise been 
exposed to poisonous or possibly toxic substances. 
 
Radiation Management Program: This is a County-wide program (Department of Public 
Health – Environmental Health) responsible for protecting the public from unnecessary

radiation exposure. With the County, Radiation Management works under contract with the 
California Department of Public Health to provide the delivery of these services. 
 
 
VMED28 Radio: The VMED28 frequency is the primary method of communications with 
paramedic providers to coordinate patient destination activities with the Medical Alert 
Center (MAC). The VMED28 also serves as a back-up communication system for intra-
hospital communication and between hospitals and the MAC. 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Donning appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) protects 
prehospital responders from significant toxic exposure. 
 
2. Accurate information obtained by prehospital personnel about the health effects of 
the hazardous material ensures appropriate prehospital evaluation and treatment for 
victims. 
 
3. Decontamination prior to transport minimizes continued exposure of the victim 
and secondary contamination of health care personnel. 
 
4. Prehospital care provided should be consistent with certification or licensure. 
 
5. To the extent possible, unnecessary contamination of patient transport 
vehicles, equipment or receiving hospital facilities should be prevented. 
 
6. Early notification of surrounding facilities will assist with efficient deployment of 
hospital decontamination team members. 
 
7. Receiving hospitals should follow their established guidelines for handling victims 
of hazardous materials incidents. 
 
POLICY: 
 
I. Medical Control 
 
A. On-line medical control during a hazardous materials exposure incident 
shall be provided by a physician and/or mobile intensive care nurse 
(MICN) from a base hospital. 
 
B. Involved base hospital personnel may contact the MAC regarding bed 
availability, Regional Mobile Response Team activation (see Ref. 817), 
poison control information, or other needed medical control services. 
 
II. Role of EMS personnel: 
 
A. Check in with the Incident Commander on scene and coordinate EMS 
activities with the personnel responsible for decontamination. 
 
B. Ensure that proper personal protective equipment is worn. 
 
C. Ensure that victims who may have a life-threatening condition are treated

as soon as possible. 
1. If chemical, treat in conjunction with decontamination, if possible. 
2. If radiation, do not delay treatment and transport to decontaminate. 
 
D. Ensure that victims who do not have a life-threatening condition but are 
contaminated by a hazardous substance are decontaminated before 
treatment. 
 
E. Ensure that all victims with chemical contamination undergo 
decontamination procedures prior to transportation from the scene. 
 
F. Ensure that patients who are not contaminated are treated consistent 
with current prehospital care policies and procedures. 
 
III. Role of the Med Com: 
 
Contact the MAC via VMED28 or landline at (866) 940-4401, option 1, or the 
assigned base hospital and provide the following information: 
 
1. Incident location 
 
2. Hazardous material involved (if known) 
 
3. Number and severity of victims 
 
4. Chief complaint of patients 
 
5. Measures already implemented to limit exposure and decontaminate 
victims 
 
6. Other information as noted in Ref. No. 519, Management of Multiple 
Casualty Incidents and Ref. No. 519.5, MCI Field Decontamination 
Guidelines, as appropriate (depending on the number of victims) 
 
7. Patient destination when hospital/bed availability is known 
 
IV. Role of the MAC and/or Base Hospital: 
 
A. Contact the Poison Control Center at (800) 222-1222 (Chemical) or the 
Department of Public Health, Radiation Management Division (213) 974-1234 
(Radiation) and provide them with a brief description of the incident and the 
hazardous materials involved and request treatment and decontamination 
information if requested by Med Com. In particular, determine if any special 
precautions must be taken to avoid contamination of health care workers, 
transport unit, hospital, other bystanders, etc. 
 
B. Notify the Med Com of any precautions that should be taken at scene. 
 
C. Identify and poll the appropriate Hospital Response Group(s) to determine 
bed availability (MAC function).
