Base Hospital Contact: Required for all patients with cardiac dysrhythmias (excludes sinus 
tachycardia) 
 
1. Assess airway and initiate basic and/or advanced airway maneuvers prn (MCG 1302) 
 
2. Administer Oxygen prn (MCG 1302) 
 
3. Initiate cardiac monitoring (MCG 1308) 
 Document cardiac rhythm and obtain12-lead ECG if dysrhythmia suspected 
 
4. Maintain supine for patients with signs of poor perfusion if respiratory status allows 
 
5. Establish vascular access prn (MCG 1375) 
 
SINUS TACHYCARDIA (Infants: heart rate < 220bpm, Children: heart rate < 180bpm) ❶ 
 
6. For adequate perfusion:  
Monitor closely for potential deterioration, rapid transport 
 
7. For poor perfusion (MCG 1355):  
Normal Saline 20mL/kg IV per MCG 1309 
 
SVT - NARROW COMPLEX (Infants: heart rate ≥ 220bpm, Children: heart rate ≥ 180bpm) 
 
8. For adequate perfusion: 
Attempt Valsalva maneuver when age appropriate 
 
9. Adenosine (3mg/mL) 0.1mg/kg rapid IV push, dose per MCG 1309, maximum 6mg ❷ 
Immediately follow with 10mL Normal Saline rapid IV flush 
 
If SVT persists: 
Adenosine (3mg/mL) 0.2mg/kg rapid IV push, dose per MCG 1309, maximum 12mg 
 
CONTACT BASE concurrent with adenosine treatment  
 
10. For persistent poor perfusion after adenosine  
CONTACT BASE to discuss order for Synchronized Cardioversion 
Synchronized cardioversion 1 J/kg, dose per MCG 1309 ❸ 
May repeat x2 at 2J/kg, dose per MCG1309 
 
Consider sedation prior to cardioversion: 
Midazolam (5mg/mL) 0.1mg/kg slow IV/IO push or 0.2 mg/kg IM/IN, dose per MCG 1309 
May repeat in 5 min prn x1 with Base order, maximum single dose 5mg

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Sinus tachycardia is common and SVT is rare. Consider sinus tachycardia in patients with history 
of fever, volume loss (e.g., vomiting or diarrhea), or congenital heart disease. An indication of 
sinus tachycardia is narrow complex and beat-to-beat variability seen on the ECG. Vital signs vary 
by age and normal ranges can be found in  MCG 1309.  Any pediatric patient with vital signs 
outside the normal range for age should be considered potentially ill and transported to an EDAP 
or PMC if criteria are met. 
 
❷    Contraindications: 2
nd
 and 3
rd
 Degree Heart Blocks; history of Sick Sinus Syndrome 
 
❸    For failure to convert or transient conversion to normal sinus rhythm, consider expedited transport.  
 
❹   Regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia may be a supraventricular rhythm with a bundle  
branch or aberrancy. In this case, Adenosine may convert the rhythm to sinus and American Heart 
Association guidelines recommend its use for regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia.
