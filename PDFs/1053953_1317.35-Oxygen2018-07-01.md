Mechanism of Action 
Oxygen is a tasteless, odorless gas transported by hemoglobin in the blood to organ tissues. It is required 
for the breakdown of glucose into a useable energy form (aerobic metabolism). Therapeutic oxygen 
administration increases the oxygen concentration in the alveoli, which in turn increases the oxygen 
saturation of available hemoglobin. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset is immediate; duration is < 2 min 
 
Contraindications 
None 
 
Adverse Effects 
High flow O
2 
(100%) by mask may produce a 30% decrease in coronary blood flow in as little as 5 min, and 
may decrease the efficiency of nitroglycerin. 
In patients with COPD or other chronic lung disease, high inspired O
2
 concentration may decrease 
respiratory drive and cause CO
2
 retention. 
O
2
 will dry mucus membranes.
