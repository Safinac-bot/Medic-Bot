Medical Control Guideline:  PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 
 
DEFINITION: Pediatric patients in the prehospital setting are defined as children 14 years of age 
and   younger or, in the case that the is age unknown, the patient can be measured on the length-
based resuscitation tape (e.g., Broselow™).  
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Pediatric patients require special consideration in assessment, treatment and 
medication administration. 
 
2. Pediatric assessment includes: pre-arrival preparation, scene size-up for hazards to 
patient or providers, assessment of scene for signs of child maltreatment, the Pediatric 
Assessment Triangle (PAT), vital signs, focused history using SAMPLE (signs and 
Symptoms, Allergies, Medications, Past Medical History, Last food or liquid intake, and 
Events leading to illness or injury), and a detailed physical exam as dictated by the 
patient’s presenting signs and symptoms and condition. 
 
3. PAT is composed of three components Appearance, Work of Breathing and 
Circulation to the Skin (Figure 1). 
 
a. The PAT is a “rapid Assessment Tool” that uses only visual and auditory clues and 
requires no equipment. 
 
b. The PAT is intended to allow the EMS provider to: 
i. Establish the child’s severity of illness 
ii. Determine sick or not sick 
iii. Recognize the general category of pathophysiology called the “general 
impression” 
iv. Determine the urgency of interventions 
 
c.   Appearance: Recalled by the mnemonic TICLS, an abnormality in any component: 
i. Tone 
ii. Interactiveness 
iii. Consolability 
iv. Look/Gaze 
v. Speech/Cry 
 
d. Work of Breathing: Presence of any of the following implies abnormal work of 
breathing. 
i. Stridor 
ii. Wheezing 
iii. Grunting 
iv. Tripod positioning 
v. Retractions 
vi. Nasal flaring 
vii. Apnea/Gasping

e. Circulation to the Skin: Presence of any of the following indicates abnormal 
circulation to the skin or signs of poor perfusion. 
i. Pale 
ii. Mottled 
iii. Cyanotic 
 
f.    Combining the PAT assessment based on these components can be used to 
determine the general impression (i.e., what, if anything, is critically wrong with the 
patient in terms of pathophysiology) which will dictate immediate management 
priorities (Figure 2): 
i. Stable 
ii. Respiratory distress 
iii. Respiratory failure 
iv. Shock 
v. CNS/Metabolic disorder 
vi. Cardiopulmonary failure/Cardiopulmonary Arrest 
 
4. Treatments, medication concentrations and drug dosages are weight-specific for the 
pediatric patient. 
 
5. Accurate pediatric drug doses are obtained by: 
 
a. Measuring the patient against a pediatric length-based resuscitation tape (e.g., 
Broselow Tape™) to obtain the weight/color zone, and then 
b. Referring to the MCG 1309 Color Code Drug Doses for the medication doses 
appropriate to that weight/color zone. 
 
6. Brief Resolved Unexplained Events (BRUE) is defined as a brief episode 
characterized by any of the following (for children 12 months of age or younger): 
 
a. Absent, decreased or irregular breathing 
b. Color change (usually cyanosis or pallor) 
c. Marked change in muscle tone (usually limpness or hypotonia, may also include 
hypertonia) 
d. Altered level of consciousness 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. Assess using the PAT and initiate immediate treatment based on your 
general impression (Stable, Respiratory Distress, Respiratory Failure/Arrest, 
Shock, Center Nervous System Disorder/Metabolic Disorder, or 
Cardiopulmonary Failure/Arrest).  
 
2. Determine your Provider Impression and continue treatment per the corresponding 
Treatment Protocol. 
 
3. Document findings of the PAT, your assessment, and your Provider Impression. 
 
4. Obtain the patient’s estimated weight utilizing a pediatric length-based resuscitation tape 
and document the corresponding weight and color zone on the EMS Report Form.

5. Pediatric Airway Management: 
 
a. Bag Mask Ventilation (BMV) is the preferred method of airway management. 
b. Nasopharyngeal (NP) airway and oropharyngeal (OP) airway are approved airway 
adjuncts to facilitate BMV.  
c. i-gel is the approved supraglottic airway for pediatric patients in whom: BMV is 
difficult or ineffective; in respiratory arrest after BMV initiated; in cardiac arrest 
once resuscitation priorities have been met. Sizing per MCG 1309. 
d. Endotracheal Intubation (ETI) is approved for patients 12 years of age or 
greater, or longer than the length of the length-based resuscitation tape and 
should be utilized for these pediatric patients when there is a need for 
advanced airway and i-gel is contraindicated. 
 
6. Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR): 
 
a. Use Neonatal CPR for newborns just after delivery in the first 24 hours of life 
b. Use Infant CPR for patients greater than 1 day of age to less than 13 
months of age 
c. Use Child CPR for patients greater than or equal to 13 months of age to the onset of 
puberty 
 
7. Automatic External Defibrillators (AED): 
Pediatric self-adhering pads or a pediatric attenuator system are recommended for 
infants and children younger than 8 years of age. When pediatric pads and/or a 
pediatric attenuator is not available, use adult AED and place front to back for infants 
and children
