Prehospital Considerations 
• Chewing allows for rapid absorption.  Chewable preparations are preferred, because it is less likely to 
provoke nausea but the pill can also be swallowed if chewable not available. 
• A significant portion (7%) of patients with asthma may have aspirin sensitivity. Careful respiratory 
monitoring should be performed on all patients with history of asthma who receive aspirin in the 
prehospital setting. 
• Tinnitus can be a clinical symptom of aspirin overdose
