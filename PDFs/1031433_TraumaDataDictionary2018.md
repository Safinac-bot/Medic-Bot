COMMON NULL VALUES 
 
Definition 
These values are to be used with each of the data elements described in this document which 
have been defined to accept the Null Values. 
 
Field Values 
• F6: Not Documented 
• F7: Not Applicable 
 
Additional Information 
• For any collection of data to be of value and reliably represent what was intended, a 
strong commitment must be made to ensure the correct documentation of incomplete 
data. 
• Not Documented (ND): This null value code applies if hospital documentation of an 
information system has an empty field or nothing is recorded.  This null value signifies that the 
hospital patient care record provides a “placeholder” to document the specific data element, 
but that no value for that element was recorded for the patient.  For example, a hospital 
patient care record may request date of birth, but the information was “Not Documented”. 
• Not Applicable (NA): This null value code applies if, at the time of patient care documentation, 
the information requested was “Not Applicable” to the patient, the hospitalization, or the 
patient care event.  For example, variables documenting EMS care would be “Not Applicable” 
if a patient self-transports to the hospital.

SEQUENCE # 
 
Definition 
Unique, alphanumeric EMS Record number found pre-printed at the top right corner of EMS Record 
hard copies or electronically assigned to electronic patient care records (ePCRs) by the EMS 
provider’s electronic capture device. 
 
Field Values 
• For EMS patients: consists of two letters and six digits on pre-printed EMS Records; or two-
letters, ten digits if an approved ePCR provider. 
• For non-EMS patients: consists of the last two digits of the current year, followed by the three-
letter trauma center code (of the first treating trauma facility), and the sequential non-EMS patient 
number. 
 
Additional Information 
• REQUIRED field for all patients. 
• Sequence #s on EMS Report Form hard copies follow “Mod-9” formula: 2 letters and 6 numbers 
that when added together are divisible by 9. 
•  ePCR sequence #s utilizes the EMS provider’s two-letter code,  the last 2-  digits of the 
incident year,  and an additional 8-digits. 
• Non-EMS patients’ sequence #s (e.g.,  20USC001) should only be utilized when ‘Entry 
Mode’ is not equal to “EMS” (ground or air). 
• DHS=No patients without an existing EMS sequence #, Non-EMS #   (e.g., 20USC001), or 
“Out-of-County” patients utilize: last two digits of the current year, followed by the two-letter 
Trauma Log Code “TL”, plus t he sequential DHS=No patient number, e.g. 18TL001. 
• Sequence #s are the essential link between the EMS, Base and Trauma databases – every 
effort should be made to collect this information from any available source.  If not 
obtainable by any means, a “dummy number” can be requested from the EMS Agency.  
Supporting documentation of collection efforts must be provided, along with other specified fields 
that will enable additional search for the patient’s sequence number in the Base and/or EMS 
databases. 
• Dummy #s will not be issued for DHS=No patients. 
• For transferred patients, or patients with more than one sequence #, use the sequence 
number from the initial contact whenever possible. 
• For DHS=YES patients arriving from outside of LA County, contact the EMS Agency to request 
an “Out-of-County” sequence #.  
• None of the sequence # formats should contain spaces. 
• Null Values are not accepted for this data field. 
 
Uses 
• Unique patient identifier. 
• Essential link between other EMS databases.

BLUNT/PENETRATING/CRITICAL BURN 
 
Definition 
Indicates the type of the injury sustained by the patient: 
• BLUNT in which the tissues are injured by forces like compression (crushing), shearing 
(tearing), acceleration, and deceleration;
 
• PENETRATING in which tissues are penetrated by single or multiple objects; or 
• CRITICAL BURN as defined as follows: 
o    Patients 15 years of age or older with 2
nd
 (partial thickness) and 3
rd
 (full thickness) 
degree burns involving equal to or greater than 20% Total Body Surface Area (TBSA). 
o Patients ≤ 14 years of age with 2
nd
 (partial thickness) and 3
rd
 (full thickness) degree 
burns involving equal to or greater than 10% TBSA. 
 
Field Values 
• B: Blunt 
• P: Penetrating 
• U: Critical Burn 
 
Additional Information 
• Injury Type, blunt, penetrating, and critical burn, is primarily utilized to identify a specific patient 
population.  For this reason, only one Injury Type can be entered. 
• The type of injury, BLUNT vs PENETRATING, should reflect the injury force, Blunt (MVA, Fall, 
Taser, & Auto vs Ped) versus Penetrating (GSW, ST, dog bite, impalement, or spearing type 
trauma). 
• Critical Burn classification, degree and TBSA, should be based upon the medic’s assessment. 
• If the patient has more than one type of injury, use the type of injury for the most significant injury, 
the injury most likely to cause prolonged disability or death. 
• Blunt force injuries can result in penetration of tissues, but the injury type is still BLUNT, (e.g., 
shrapnel from a bomb blast, firework injury, punched a window, etc.). 
 
Uses 
• Assists with determination of treatment and transport. 
• Provides documentation of assessment and/or care.

Additional Information 
• If the patient has multiple injuries, enter the most significant injury first (most likely to be fatal). 
• The injury description should reflect the injury force, Blunt (MVA, Fall, Auto vs Ped) versus 
Penetrating (GSW, ST, impalement, or spearing type trauma), selected. 
• If the patient has an injury that fits multiple field values, e.g., Blunt Chest (BC) and Flail Chest 
(FC), Blunt Head (BH) and Blunt Head with GCS ≤14 (14), use the most significant injury.  Flail 
Chest is a more significant injury than Blunt Chest,  as is Blunt Head with GCS ≤14 more 
significant than Blunt Head. 
• 14, 90, RR should not be used instead of/or in addition to PT and BT. 
• Field value cannot be left blank.

Additional Information 
• If the patient has more than one MOI use all that apply, e.g. Enclosed Vehicle (EV), Extrication 
Required (EX), and Passenger Space Intrusion >12 Inches (12).   
• If the patient has multiple MOIs, enter the most significant MOI first. 
• For PSI to meet Trauma Criteria and/or Guidelines per Reference No. 506, the intrusion must be 
specified as greater than 12 inches into an occupied passenger space, or greater than 18 inches 
into an unoccupied passenger space. 
• Insect bites and bee stings are not considered animal bites, and should be coded as “Other” and 
do not meet the inclusion criteria for the trauma registry.

Additional Information 
• Head CT results are NOT considered abnormal if a facial fracture is  the only abnormality 
identified. 
• The codes for CT’s with contrast are for Low Osmolar Contrast. 
• For CTs using Other Contrast, replace the Approach Code of 1 (5
th
 Digit) with Y. 
• Code all CTs individually by “body part”. 
• Field value must be “Not Applicable” if   no radiological studies were performed. 
• Field value cannot be left blank.

Additional Information 
• CTs and MRIs are diagnostic radiology and may or may not include contrast. 
• The ONLY difference between a diagnostic CT and MRI done with contrast versus 
“angiography” (CTA or MRA), is the timing of the contrast.  To decrease variability and increase 
interrater reliability, simply code either procedure as a CT or MRI. 
• Repeated diagnostic procedures (e.g., repeated CT scan) should not be recorded (record only 
the first procedure). 
• Record subsequent radiology studies if they identify missed injuries. 
• Interventional Angiogram (Catheter Angiogram, Formal Angiogram) involves interventional 
radiology (IR).  IR is considered an invasive procedure; therefore, IR procedures should not be 
coded in the radiology section, they belong in the procedure section.  For IR a special 
catheter is inserted into an artery or vein through a small incision, and is moved directly into the 
artery being studied.  X-ray images can be obtained while contrast is delivered directly into the 
artery being studied and allows for embolization, coiling, or other treatment if needed.

Results of radiological studies, if applicable. 
 
Field Values

Additional Information 
• Abnormal results are radiological findings due to the traumatic event.  For example, a cervical 
spine x-ray with degenerative findings, is an abnormality; however, it is not a result of trauma.  
Therefore, the cervical spine x-ray would be considered normal. 
• Head CT results are NOT considered abnormal if a facial fracture is the only abnormality 
identified. 
• (Radiology) results are ONLY considered abnormal if the abnormality identified corresponds to 
the ordered body region being imaged, e.g.
 C-spine should not be identified as abnormal due to 
rib fractures previously identified on the CXR. 
• “Possible”, “Probable”, “Questionable”, etc. radiology findings not substantiated by the discharge 
diagnosis should not be recorded as abnormal.

Additional Information 
• REBOA is a minimally invasive procedure to temporarily occlude large vessels (aorta) in support 
of hemorrhage control.  REBOA helps maintain blood flow to critical organs until the hemorrhage 
control can be definitively controlled via surgery.  Therefore, it is not considered a first type of 
surgery for hemorrhage control. 
• If unclear if surgery performed was for hemorrhage control, consult with the Trauma Medical 
Director or relevant surgeon. 
• First surgery performed for hemorrhage control does not have to be performed in the OR (e.g., 
Thoracotomy performed in the ED). 
• Enter the null value of “Not Applicable” for patients that do not meet the collection criteria.

Additional Information 
• Applies to medical treatments that may affect the first assessment of GCS.  This field does not 
apply to self-medications the patient may have administered (i.e., ETOH, prescriptions, etc.). 
• Requires review of all data sources to obtain the highest GCS motor score which might occur 
after the ED phase of care. 
• Must be the assessment qualifier for the Highest GCS Total. 
• If an intubated patient has recently received an agent that results in neuromuscular blockade 
such that a motor or eye response is not possible, then the patient should be considered to have 
an exam that is not reflective of their neurologic status and the chemical sedation modifier should 
be selected. 
• Neuromuscular blockade is typically induced following the administration of agents like 
Succinylcholine, Mivacurium, Rocuronium, Atracurium, Vecuronium, or Pancuronium.  While 
these are the most common agents, please review what might be typically used in your center so 
it can be identified in the medical record. 
• Each of these agents has a slightly different duration of action, so their effect on the GCS 
depends on when they were given. For example, Succinylcholine’s effects last for only 5-10 
minutes.

• ICD-10-CM codes are in the range of T20-T28 and T30-T32, or compatible ICD-10-CA code 
range, have been removed for NTDS’s inclusion criteria. 
• ICD-10 codes should be listed starting with the most significant injury. 
• The primary injury resulting in the hospitalization should be listed first. 
• The “significance” of other injuries should be based upon severity and location. 
• Patients with ONLY ICD-10 NFS codes or unspecified codes, resulting in an AIS severity score of 
9, and no ISS score, should be DHS=No patients. 
• Enter the COVID-19 ICD-10 code if the patient arrives with a known positive test or a positive test 
is acquired while hospitalized. 
• Additional injuries identified at the transferring facilities should not be entered into the database 
by the sending facility.  This allows for accurate reflection of the extent of the patient’s known 
injuries while being treated at the sending facility.  If additional injuries are identified at the 
receiving facility they will be documented accordingly. 
• Patients transferred from the ED are excluded from the TQIP® benchmark reports and thus this 
will have no effect on the sending facility’s benchmarking reports. 
• To ensure that the data accurately reflects the extent of the patient’s injuries, if a Coroner’s report 
is received enter any additional injuries identified in the autopsy report.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES – ABBREVIATED INJURY SCALE 
 
Definition 
The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)  is an anatomical-based coding system to classify and describe 
the severity of injuries.  It represents the threat to life associated with the injury rather than the 
comprehensive assessment of the severity of the injury. 
 
Field Values 
• Up to six-digit positive numeric value 
 
Additional Information 
• The scale describes three aspects of the injury, type, location, and severity using 7 numbers 
written as 123456.7 
 
THE NUMBERS 123456.7  
INDICATE THE FOLLOWING: 
EXAMPLE: 851814.3,  
FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURE 
1 –   Body Region 
1.    Head (Cranium & Brain) 
2.    Face (including eyes & ears) 
3.    Neck 
4.    Thorax 
5.    Abdomen 
6.    Spine 
7.    Upper Extremity 
8.    Lower Extremity 
9.    External & Other 
8 = Body Region: Lower Extremity 
2 –   Type of Anatomic Structure 5 = Type of Anatomic Structure: Skeletal 
3 & 4 –   Specific Anatomic Structure 18 = Specific Anatomic Structure: Femur 
5 & 6 –   Level of Injury 14 = Level of Injury: Shaft 
.7  –   AIS: Severity Score (Ranging from 1 {least severe} to 6 
{most severe}) 
1.    Minor 
2.    Moderate 
3.    Serious 
4.    Severe 
5.    Critical 
6.    Maximal (currently untreatable) 
9.    Unable to assign 
.3 = AIS: Severity Score: Serious 
 
• To ensure that the data accurately reflects the extent of the patient’s injuries, if a Coroner’s report 
is received enter any additional injuries identified in the autopsy report. 
• Enter AIS: Severity Score of “9” if it is not possible to assign a severity to an injury. 
• In Trauma One the AIS is displayed as AIS Severity (postdot), ISS Body Part, and then AIS 6-
digit code (predot). 
• Field value cannot be “Not Applicable”. 
• Field cannot be left blank. 
 
Uses 
• Used to calculate Injury Severity Score. 
• Assists with determination of appropriate treatment. 
• System evaluation and monitoring.

Additional Information 
• For patients pronounced brain dead and whose care is assumed by an organ procurement 
agency enter “Morgue”. 
• Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) focus on patients who, on average, stay more than 25 days, 
and no longer need the level of services that an acute care hospital provides. 
• A SNF is an institution that provides skilled nursing care after a patient no longer needs the level 
of services that an acute care hospital provides. 
• “Home” refers to the patient’s current place of residence, e.g., prison, Child Protective Services, 
etc. 
• For patients that report their current place of residence as “homeless”, but are discharged to an 
existing residence, e.g., family member’s residence, enter “Home With” or “Home W/O”. 
• Patients discharged to Hospice care are considered a death by TQIP
®
 for purposes of risk-
adjusted benchmark reporting.

SUBJECT: TRAUMA CENTER DATA DICTIONARY   REFERENCE NO. 646 
 
 
Appendix 3 – Auto-calculated Variables PAGE 328 OF 328
 
AUTO-CALCULATED VARIABLES 
 
Injury Severity Score: The Injury Severity Score (ISS) is an anatomical scoring system that provides an 
overall score for patients with multiple injuries. 
Calculation: Each injury is assigned an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score and is allocated to 
one of six body regions (Head, Face, Chest, Abdomen, Extremities (including Pelvis) and 
External).  The 3 most severely injured body regions have their AIS score squared and added 
together to produce the ISS score.  Only the highest AIS score in each body region is used.  The 
ISS score takes values from 0 to 75.  If an injury is assigned an AIS of 6 (un-survivable injury), 
the ISS score is automatically assigned to 75. 
Overall GCS - EMS score (adult and pediatric): A scale calculated in the out-of-hospital setting which 
evaluates the patient's initial level of awareness, which indirectly indicates the extent of neurologic injury.  
The score is based upon three categories of patient responses; eye opening, verbal response, and motor 
response.  The lowest score is 3 and is indicative of no response, the highest score is 15, indicates the 
patient is alert and aware of his or her surroundings. 
Calculation: Initial Field GCS Eye + Initial Field GCS Verbal + Initial Field GCS Motor 
Overall GCS - ED score (adult and pediatric): A scale calculated in the emergency department (ED) or 
hospital setting which evaluates the patient's initial (upon arrival) level of awareness, which indirectly 
indicates the extent of neurologic injury.  The score is based upon three categories of patient responses; 
eye opening, verbal response, and motor response.  The lowest score is 3 and is indicative of no 
response, the highest score is 15, indicates the patient is alert and aware of his or her surroundings. 
 Calculation: Initial ED/Hospital GCS Eye + Initial ED/Hospital GCS Verbal + Initial ED/Hospital 
GCS Motor 
Revised Trauma Score - ED (adult and pediatric): The Revised Trauma Score is a physiological 
scoring system used to predict death from injury or need for trauma center care.  It is scored based upon 
the initial vital signs obtained from the patient in the ED or hospital setting. 
 Calculation: RTS = 0.9368 (Initial ED/Hospital GCS Total) + 0.7326 (Initial ED/Hospital Systolic 
Blood Pressure) + 0.2908 (Initial ED/Hospital Respiratory Rate) 
Total Length of Hospital Stay: The total elapsed time the patient was in the hospital. 
 Calculation: Hospital Discharge Date/Time – ED/Hospital Arrival Date/Time 
Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS)/ Probability of Survival (POS): The Trauma Injury Severity 
Score (TRISS) determines the Probability of Survival of a patient based upon the patient’s age, type of 
injury (blunt versus penetrating), the Injury Severity Score (ISS), and the Revised Trauma Score
 (RTS). 
Length of Stay (Days) in Readmission:  The total elapsed time the patient was in the hospital for 
readmission. 
 Calculation:  Readmit Discharge Date/Time – Date/Time of Readmission
