Member Boards of the American Board of Medical Specialists (ABMS) or American Osteopathic 
Association (AOA) including an examination designed to assess the knowledge, skills, and 
experience necessary to provide quality patient care in a particular specialty. 
 
Board Eligible (BE): Successful completion of a residency training program with progression to 
board certification based on the timeframe as specified by the ABMS or AOA for a specific 
specialty. 
 
Interventional Cardiologist: Physician who has completed a residency in internal medicine, or 
fellowship in cardiology and/or interventional cardiology, and is BC or BE, and has privileges to 
perform percutaneous interventions.  
 
Out-of-Hospital Non-traumatic Cardiac Arrest (OHCA):  Sudden, sometimes temporary 
cessation of function of the heart not due to a traumatic cause. 
 
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI): A procedure used to open or widen a narrowed or 
blocked coronary artery to restore blood flow supplying the heart. 
 
Promptly Available: Able to be physically present in the emergency department (ED) within a 
period of time that is medically prudent and appropriate to the patient’s clinical condition; and 
further, should not have a measurable harmful effect on the course of the patient management 
or outcome. Hospital guidelines shall be established that address response time for on-call 
physicians, usually 30 minutes or less. 
 
Qualified Specialist: A physician licensed in the State of California who has become BC or BE 
in the corresponding specialty by American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or American

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:  
 
The input of the Hospital Association of Southern California’s (HASC) Emergency Health 
Services Committee and the Cardiac Technical Advisory Group (TAG) was essential in the 
initial development of these standards.  The TAG was composed of a cardiologist from the 
American Heart Association; Emergency Department physicians from teaching and community 
hospitals; an EMS Commissioner; nurse managers from emergency departments and 
catheterization labs; members of the Association of Prehospital Care Coordinators; a Paramedic 
Nurse Educator; and the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency.  Additional contributions 
were made by the Medical Council of the EMS Agency, the Commission, the American Heart 
Association and the Los Angeles County Medical Association.
