Communications 
Plan 
The local EMS agency shall 
plan for EMS 
communications.  The plan 
shall specify the medical 
communications capabilities 
of emergency medical 
transport vehicles, non-
transporting advanced life 
support responders, and 
acute care facilities and shall 
coordinate the use of 
frequencies with other users.

plan should consider the 
availability and use of 
satellites and cellular 
telephones. 
 
X   CURRENT STATUS:   
21 Base Stations and 49 
paramedic provider agencies, 
which account for the 678 dual-
paramedic public provider units, 
who have access to 9 medical 
channels.  Medical channels are 
assigned to the hospital base 
station.  Communication 
assignments have been developed 
and implemented.  Hospital base 
stations are assigned a primary 
channel and, in most cases, a 
backup frequency. 
 
LEMSA communication standards 
require 90% coverage, 90% of the 
time.  The standard is maintained 
by the installation of local base 
stations at the hospital site and 
remote base stations at 
strategically placed sites to 
overcome communication 
problems caused by terrain.  
LEMSA has installed and 
maintains 11 remote base stations 
on the mainland and 3 remote 
base stations on Catalina Island.
