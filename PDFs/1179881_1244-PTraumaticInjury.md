SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶      EMS Personnel are mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect, and a report should be made 
when suspected as per Ref. 822. Communicate suspicion for child abuse and/or neglect to 
accepting ED staff when home suggests children could be at risk for harm (e.g., unkept home, 
evidence of drug or alcohol abuse, unsafe living conditions, known or suspected domestic violence), 
when the history does not match with the severity of physical findings (e.g., child posturing after a 
roll off the couch), when patterned injury or burns or noted (e.g., circular burns as from a cigarette, 
whip marks on the skin, burns of both hands or feet), or when child reports physical or sexual abuse. 
Children < 3 years of age and those with developmental delay are at increased risk of abuse.  This 
must also be accompanied by notification to the Department of children and Family Services 
(DCFS). 
 
❷ For patients requiring transport to a Pediatric Trauma Center per Ref. 506, which is also a Base 
Hospital, contact receiving Pediatric Trauma Center for Base Medical Direction and notification.  
If the Base Hospital is contacted and the Base redirects transport to a Pediatric Trauma Center, 
Base personnel will notify the Pediatric Trauma Center. 
 
❸  Transport should be prioritized over advanced airway placement unless BMV is ineffective. Advanced 
airway may be placed during transport as authorized per MCG 1302; supraglottic airway (sizing per 
MCG 1309) is preferred unless contraindicated. Paramedics should use judgment based on patient 
characteristics, circumstances, and skill level when selecting the advanced airway modality for 
pediatric patients in whom multiple modalities are authorized. 
 
❹       A backboard is not required for spinal motion restriction (SMR) and may cause harm as well as   
increased pain. Patients should not be transported on a backboard for the purpose of SMR. If a 
backboard is used for extrication, patients who are alert should then be logrolled onto the gurney 
prior to transport. The backboard may be used during patient transport for splinting of multiple 
simultaneous extremity fractures or to assist with maneuvering the unconscious patient. In all cases, 
the backboard should be removed immediately if causing respiratory compromise.   
 
❺    Infants and small children are at high risk for hypothermia due to their large surface area to body 
mass ratio, reduced ability to shiver, and limited body fat. 
 
❻ Traumatic events may be due to a medical emergency, e.g. seizure. 
 
❼  Placement of a vented dressing can prevent conversion of an open pneumothorax to a tension 
pneumothorax. However, tension pneumothorax may still develop in the presence of a vented 
dressing and should be treated with needle thoracostomy. Furthermore, needle thoracostomy in a 
patient with evidence of tension pneumothorax should not be delayed for placement of dressing. 
 
❽ Fluid resuscitation increases vascular pressure and dilutes clotting factors, which may increase 
internal bleeding. For patients at risk of internal hemorrhage, fluids should only be administered for 
hypotension and other signs of poor perfusion, titrated to maintain SBP within normal range for age. 
In patients with penetrating trauma, permissive hypotension (withholding fluids if patient has normal 
mental status) is preferred to reduce ongoing blood loss. Patients with ALOC or hypotension should 
receive fluids until their mental status and SBP improve. Permissive hypotension is contraindicated in 
patients with possible traumatic brain injury.

❾    Vomiting should be prevented and/or immediately treated in patients with head injury, since it 
increases intra-cranial pressure and can compromise the patient’s airway. 
 
❿   Any hypoxic episode, even brief, is associated with worse patient outcome for patients with traumatic 
brain injury. 
 
⓫ Hyperventilation reduces blood flow to the brain by reducing CO
2
 and is associated with worse 
outcomes in severe head injuries. Ventilate to maintain an ETCO
2
 in the range 35-45mmHg.  
 
⓬    Any hypotension increases mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. Normal Saline should be 
initiated to maintain SBP within normal range for age at all times but can be withheld if the blood 
pressure is elevated. The level of systolic blood pressure varies by age. Those thresholds are found 
in MCG 1309 and should be used in decisions for fluid resuscitation.  
  
⓭    A head-elevated position at about 30 degrees reduces intra-cranial pressure and improves 
respiratory status. Reverse Trendelenburg is an option for patients that cannot be seated. Patients 
who are hypotensive should be maintained supine unless airway compromise requires repositioning. 
 
⓮    Open femur fracture is not a contraindication to apply the traction splint. If the bone is protruding and 
there is gross contamination, wash with saline prior to applying the splint.
