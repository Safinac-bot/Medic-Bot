Classification 
 Electrolyte 
 
LA County Prehospital Indications 
Cardiac Arrest – Non-Traumatic:  suspected hyperkalemia, patients with renal failure 
Cardiac Dysrhythmia: suspected hyperkalemia causing bradycardia  
Overdose / Poisoning / Ingestion: calcium channel and/or beta blocker toxicity 
Traumatic Injury:  suspected hyperkalemia in the setting of crush injury or potential for development of 
crush syndrome (administer prior to release of crushed tissue) 
 
Other Common Indications (Not authorized for EMS administration in LA County) 
Acute hypocalcemia with or without tetany 
Topically for hydrofluoric acid burns 
 
Adult Dose 
Cardiac Arrest 
1g (10mL) IVP/IO 
Cardiac Dysrhythmia/Crush - Suspected hyperkalemia  
 1g (10mL) slow IV/IO push, may repeat x1 for persistent symptoms / ECG abnormalities 
Overdose / Poisoning / Ingestion - Suspected Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose 
 1g (10mL) IV slow push over 60 seconds 
Pediatric Dose 
Crush - Suspected hyperkalemia 
20mg/kg (100mg/mL) slow IV/IO push, dose per MCG 1309, repeat x1 for persistent ECG 
abnormalities 
Overdose / Poisoning / Ingestion - Suspected Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose 
 20mg/kg (100mg/mL) IV slow push over 60 seconds, dose per MCG 1309 
Mechanism of Action 
Essential regulator for the excitation threshold of nerves and muscles; causes significant increase in 
myocardial contractility and ventricular automaticity. Antidote for some electrolyte imbalances and calcium 
channel and/or beta blocker toxicity. 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
Onset and peaks immediately, duration varies 
 
Contraindications 
Hypercalcemia 
 
Interactions 
Inactivates or minimizes the effects of catecholamines if not flushed properly 
Can cause cardiac standstill in patients taking Digoxin 
 
Adverse Effects 
Cardiac arrest 
Hypotension or hypertension 
Pain and burning at injection site 
Tingling sensations 
 
Prehospital Considerations 
• Precipitates to form calcium carbonate (chalk) when used with sodium bicarbonate. Administer calcium 
chloride and sodium bicarbonate in separate IV/ IO or thoroughly flush in between administrations 
using at least 10mL of normal saline 
• Confirm IV is patent prior to administration as extravasation causes severe tissue necrosis
