SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶    Treatment of sinus tachycardia should be directed at the underlying cause.  Sinus tachycardia due to 
conditions such as hypovolemia, sepsis, or GI bleed can present as a wide complex tachycardia in 
patients with left or right bundle branch blocks.  P waves should be visible before each QRS and a 
typical bundle branch block pattern noted on the ECG.  
 
❷   Tachycardia is often a response to an underlying illness including but not limited to: sepsis, GI 
bleeding, respiratory distress, anaphylaxis, hyperthermia, and toxic ingestions.  Sinus tachycardia 
may be a manifestation of pain and/or anxiety, but these should not be considered until other, more 
dangerous etiologies, are evaluated. 
 
❸    Sinus tachycardia can occur at a rate above 150 bpm. Sinus tachycardia does not respond to 
Adenosine, so it should not be administered, and treatment should be directed at the underlying 
cause.   
 
❹   Adenosine is contraindicated in patients with history of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome and 
atrial fibrillation, Sick Sinus Syndrome, or heart transplant; or if the patient’s medications include 
carbamazepine (Tegretol) for seizure disorder. In these patients, adenosine may cause degeneration 
to a fatal dysrhythmia. 
 
❺    Altered level of consciousness (ALOC) refers to a decreased or depressed level of consciousness 
compared to the patient’s baseline (secondary to shock or hypoperfusion).  
 
❻   Patients with atrial fibrillation (or flutter) have abnormal impulses generated by the atria. Adenosine is 
not effective to slow or terminate the rhythm and, in the presence of Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) 
Syndrome, can cause ventricular fibrillation. Further, these rhythms cause abnormal contraction of 
the atria that can lead to clot formation. Cardioversion increases the risk for stroke as these clots can 
be forced out of the atria into circulation after cardioversion. Consider and treat underlying causes of 
rapid atrial fibrillation (e.g. dehydration, sepsis) prior to cardioversion. Cardioversion is appropriate for 
cases of acute onset (<48 hours) atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability and without other 
apparent cause.  
 
❼ Regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia may be supraventricular rhythm with a bundle 
branch block or aberrancy. In this case, Adenosine may convert the rhythm to sinus and AHA 
guidelines recommend its use for regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia. Adenosine should 
not be used for irregular wide complex tachycardia, because this may represent atrial fibrillation with 
WPW and lead to degeneration to a fatal dysrhythmia (see ❹ above).
