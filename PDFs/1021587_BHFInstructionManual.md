• Not Applicable: This null value code applies if the field doesn’t apply to the current situation 
or patient record. (e.g., “Total Min. EMS CPR”, if the patient was transported, enter “Not 
Applicable” (F7) in TEMIS) 
• Blank: Is not a null value, but regarded as an empty cell 
• If data is missing or unknown, check the relevant fields to see if a null value is appropriate 
for data entry

value, always beginning with the two-letter provider code followed by the two-digit year.  
Neither format should contain spaces 
• If sequence number is missing or incorrectly documented, every effort must be taken by the 
base hospital to obtain it – either by reviewing the audio recording or by contacting the 
appropriate provider agency directly.  Only after all efforts to obtain the actual sequence 
number have been exhausted may a request be made to the EMS Agency for assistance, or  
a ”dummy” sequence number as a final option.  Such requests should be submitted in a 
timely manner   
• A fictitious sequence number should not be generated for any reason

DATA ENTRY INSTRUCTIONS 
 
MCI Form 
 
• A tool that collects essential information in an organized and simple manner to expedite 
patient treatment and transport 
 
• The MCI form is useful when the provider declares the incident to be an MCI 
 
• The MCI form contains four (4) patient records, document one (1) patient per record 
 
Data Entry 
 
• To access the MCI Tab, select the Tools button on the toolbar and then select the 
Personal Settings button.  Change the Pathway to MCI form and select Ok. 
 
• To enter another record from the same incident, go to the File button and select Copy 
Patient.  This shortcut will copy the general information from the previous record on to 
the new record. 
 
• To clear the MCI settings. Go to the Tools button on the toolbar and select the Personal 
Settings button.  Change the Pathway to Base form and select Ok.  Then select the 
Modules button on the toolbar and Report Generator/Reports.  When the report page 
opens, select the Modules button/Data Entry on the toolbar to begin base form entry.
