ANNUAL EMS PLAN UPDATE 
(Fiscal Year 2019-2020) 
 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
 
Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.254, requires the Emergency Medical 
Services (EMS)  Agency to submit an EMS Plan to the State EMS Authority and follow it with 
annual updates thereafter.  Attached is the Los Angeles County FY 2019-2020 Annual 
Update which provides the required information on the status of our system and the EMS 
Agency's progress toward meeting long-range goals.   
 
Communications: 
 
The EMS Agency continues to be an active participant and voting member of the governing 
body of the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS) Board 
of Directors.  LA-RICS’ mission is to provide the finest mission-critical communication 
system with unwavering focus on the needs of the public safety professional. It is being 
designed and built to serve law enforcement and fire service first responders, along with 
health service professionals throughout Los Angeles County. 
 
With over 80 public safety agencies with approximately 34,000 first-responders and 
encompassing a sprawling terrain of over 4,060 square miles that approximately 10 million 
people call home, the Los Angeles region seeks a modern interoperable public safety 
broadband network that allows multiple agencies to respond to the widest possible variety 
of emergencies. LA-RICS has transferred operation and ownership of its 700MHz 
broadband network to ATT/First-Net, which is based on 4G/5G wireless data technology. 
The network would enable computer-aided dispatch, rapid law-enforcement queries, real-
time video streaming, medical telemetry, patient tracking, geographic information systems 
services for first responders, and many other broadband-specific applications. 
LA-RICS is partnered with AT&T/First-Net, a nationwide first responder network authority to 
ensure coordination with the broadband network on a national level for public safety and 
first responders. 
 
EMS System Data Report: 
 
Efforts to incorporate the STEMI and stroke databases into a combined database with the 
three (3) core EMS Agency databases (EMS, base hospital, and trauma center) continue.  
To further enhance reporting and access capability, the EMS Agency continues to explore 
opportunities to improve TEMIS, such as a web-based solution. 
 
Of the ~700,000 EMS responses in the County, 100% of patient care records from public 
EMS providers are now collected through an electronic patient care report (ePCR).   
 
NEMSIS Compliance (78% of system data for the reporting period FY 19-20): 
 
 

 
 
 
Executive Summary 
Page 2 of 4 
 
Los Angeles County Fire District – (46% of system data) utilized Stryker through June 29, 
2020, and converted to ImageTrend’s ePCR platform on June 30, 2020. 
City of Los Angeles Fire Department – (31% of system data) uti   lize Stryker. 
Cities of Torrance and Redondo Beach Fire Department’s (2% of system data) – utilize 
W.A.T.E.R. 
 
Non-NEMSIS Compliance (21% of system data for the reporting period FY 19-20) which 
involves the remaining 26 fire departments utilizing Digit  al EMS. Digit   al EMS became 
compliant for NEMSIS 3.5 to both collect and send data on April 28, 2021. 
 
During FY 19-20, the EMS Agency submitted 100% records to CEMSIS-Trauma; however, 
did not export EMS related data to CEMSIS. 
 
Sidewalk CPR: 
 
The EMS Agency Sidewalk CPR is an annual program that traditionally provides in-person 
“hands-only”  CPR training throughout Los Angeles County during National CPR & AED 
Awareness Week (June1-7). The Sidewalk CPR program was suspended in 2020 due to 
COVID-19. 
 
Exclusive Operating Areas (EOA) for 9-1 -1 Transportation:  
 
There were no changes to the nine (9) EOAs in Los Angeles County and are served by the 
following ambulance companies to provide 9-1 -1 transportation services as follows:

Los Angeles County Disaster Health Care Coalition (HCC): 
 
The HCC was established in October 2013 to coordinate strategic planning activit   ies 
amongst healthcare facilities in various healthcare delivery sectors, public health agencies, 
other government entities and community partners to prepare for, respond to, and recover 
from emergencies and other incidents that impact the public’s health. 
 
Los Angeles County’s HCC has an advisory committee with representatives from acute care 
hospitals, community health centers, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers, ambulatory 
surgery centers, home health/hospice agencies, EMS providers, volunteer organizations, 
and government agencies that support Emergency Support Function 8 (ESF 8) functions.  
The advisory committee is co-chaired by the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical 
Services Agency and Department of Public Health and meets three times per year to 
facilitate: 
 
•    Strategic planning 
•    Identification of gaps and mitigation strategies 
•    Operational planning and response 
•    Information sharing for improved situational awareness 
•    Resource coordination and management

communication plan 
should consider the 
availability and use of 
satellites and cellular 
telephones. 
X   CURRENT STATUS:   
21 Base Stations and 49 paramedic 
provider agencies, which account for 
the 678 dual-paramedic public provider 
units, who have access to 9 medical 
channels.  Medical channels are 
assigned to the hospital base station.  
Communication assignments have been 
developed and implemented.  Hospital 
base stations are assigned a primary 
channel and, in most cases, a backup 
frequency. 
 
LEMSA communication standards 
require 90% coverage, 90% of the time.  
The standard is maintained by the 
installation of local base stations at the 
hospital site and remote base stations 
at strategically placed sites to overcome 
communication problems caused by 
terrain.  LEMSA has installed and 
maintains 11 remote base stations on 
the mainland and 3 remote base

ed States we work collabora-
tively   with   our   prehospital,   
emergency     medicine     and     
inpatient   providers   to   inte-
grate  all  settings  of  care  for  
outcome optimization.  
The  EMS  Agency  and  provid-
ers  have  done  a  lot  of  work  
related  to  data  from  2010  -
19. The initiation of electron-
ic  data  capturing  in  the  field  
has    been    a    tremendous    
effort  for  the  providers,  ven-
dors,  and  the  agency  staff.  
The   addition   of   electronic   
data  capturing  has  allowed  us  to  be  more  nimble  and  
accurate  with  our  data  reporting  and  system  monitor-
ing.  Though,  not  easy,  it  has  created  great  opportuni-
ties for our system. 
We  have  successfully  implemented  Provider  Impres-
sion which empowers the EMS professionals to provide 
specific  prehospital  care  based  on  our  protocols.  In  
response  to  this  change  from  a  chief  complaint-based  
system  of  care  to  a  Provider  Impression  based  care,  
we  are  able  to  better  define  patient  needs,  provide  
more specific care, and evaluate that care in our quali-
ty improvement plan for the county.   
Our  Trauma  system  has  been  in  effect  for  over  35  
years   and   provides   needed   trauma   care   to   over   
22,000  trauma  patients  per  year.  This  report  outlines  
mechanism of injury and identifies falls as the leading 
mechanism of injury in our county. These data provide 
the  basis  of  local  and  regional  injury  prevention  pro-
grams. 
Our  ST  elevation  myocardial  infraction  (heart  attack)  
centers  continue  to  provide  rapid  treatment  of  heart  
attack  and  also  serve  as  cardiac  arrest  centers  where  
patients   receive   post   resuscitation   care.   We   have   
worked collaboratively with public health to increase train-
ing  in  hands  only  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  
which has led to an increase  in  bystander  CPR  rates  12%  
to  31%.  We  have  also  seen  a  continued  increase  in  our  
return  of  spontaneous  circulation  (ROSC)  rates  from  14%  
to  45%  in  2018.  What  an  achievement for  all  our  EMS  
providers and our system.  
In 2017, 2018 and 2019 the EMS Agency and fire depart-
ment  partners  received  the  American  Heart  Association  
Mission Lifeline GOLD award for data submission. This is a 
huge  achievement  for  our  system  and  offers  a  vision  for  
our  future  collaborations  that  will  improve  patient  care  
and outcome. 
In  2018  we  implemented  a  two-tier  stroke  system  that  
designates  both  Primary  and  Comprehensive  stroke  cen-
ters.  This  expansion  of  compre-
hensive  services  allows  for  pa-
tients  to  be  identified  by  para-
medics that have severe strokes 
and   then   transported   to   the   
Comprehensive    stroke    center    
which  has  the  ability  to  rapidly  
treat   the   stroke   by   emergent   
removal  of  offending  blood  clots  
in  the  circulation  of  the  brain.  
This  change  in  our  system  has  
resulted in greater access of this 
important   therapy   for   patients   
as well as improved outcomes. 
In   2019,   our   Stroke   System   
received  an  award  from  the  Los  
Angeles  County  Productivity  and  
Quality Commission, recognizing 
Innovative  Ideas.  In  addition,  our  data  is  being  used  to  
critically  analyze  our  EMS  system  performance.  On  the  
national level, data has helped us to set the standards for 
other systems. 
Throughout this report, the data show that we are meeting 
basic standards for care, particularly in time performance, 
such as field time, time to EKG, to specialty center and to 
critical  intervention.  The  next  decade,  2020,  we  will  be  
pushing  to  not  just  meet  performance  standards  but  to  
exceed them when appropriate and in the best interest of 
the patient. 
Many thanks to our EMS Agency data staff and the leader-
ship  and  talent  of  Richard  Tadeo,  Assistant  Director,  for  
not only their work on this report but for the daily efforts in 
managing and ensure the data quality for the system.

Since the implementation of a two-
tiered stroke routing system in Los 
Angeles County on January 8, 2018, 
thrombectomy access increased to 
93% of the population and the 
frequency of thrombectomy more 
than doubled. Interfacility transfers 
for higher level of care declined.

We  are  dedicating  this  issue  of  the  EMS  Sys-
tem  Report  to  Michelle  Williams,  Chief,  Data 
Systems     Management     for     our     agency.  
Michelle  has  worked  with  the  EMS  Agency  for 
the  past  9  years.    She  has  served  as  the  lead 
of our Data  Management  Section since 2018.   
Michelle   has   been   in-
strumental    in    moving 
the   EMS   Agency   and 
our system to electronic 
data   collection,   ensur-
ing    data    quality    and 
consistency,   and   edu-
cating     our     providers 
and   hospitals   on   the 
importance    of    quality 
data  to  direct  our  sys-
tem and patient care. 
 
Michelle    worked    tirelessly,    starting    from 
scratch, to evolve our system from a  predomi-
nantly  pen  and  paper  system  to  the  100% 
electronic  system  we  have  today.    She  has 
worked  with  each  provider  agency,  hospital 
and digital system to convert LA County over to 
an  entirely  new  platform.    Her  understanding 
of data management has enabled us to utilize 
this critical information to make vital decisions 
and   conduct   quality   improvement   and   re-
search on behalf of the over 10 million people 
who  live  in  and  visit  our  county.    She  dedicated 
countless hours this past year collecting and veri-
fying COVID hospital assessment  data  which  was 
critical to the county’s understanding of the pan-
demic and provided support to policy decisions. 
 
Michelle has recently left our EMS Agency to pur-
sue  personal  goals.    Her  talent  and  drive  will  be 
sorely  missed.    I  hope  you  will  join  us  in  wishing 
Michelle  the   best   in   her   new   endeavors   and 
thanking  her  for  instilling  excellence  in  our  EMS 
program and systems.  
 
This  last  year  has  been  a  challenging  one  for  all 
of  EMS.  As  the  pandemic  wanes  we  honor  all 
those  who  participated  in 
the  response  locally  and 
regionally.  Data  played  a 
critical role in the manage-
ment of the pandemic and 
allowed   for   opportunities 
for  the  system  to  predict 
surge.   Thanks   to   all   for 
their  dedication  in  caring 
for   our   EMS   community 
this last year.

Critical—a patient presents an acute injury or illness that could result in permanent damage, injury or death (head injury, vehicular accident, shooting). Applicable  
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for this level of service would be 99284 (detailed history, detailed physical, and medical decision making of moderate 
complexity) or 99285 (medical decision making of high complexity) or 99291 (critical care, evaluation and management). 
Urgent—a  patient  with an acute injury or illness, loss of life or limb is not an immediate threat to their well-being, or a patient who needs timely evaluation (fracture or 
laceration). Applicable CPT codes for this level of service would be 99282 (medical decision making of low complexity) or 99283 (medical decision making of moderate 
complexity). 
Non-Urgent—a patient with a non-emergent injury, illness or condition; sometimes chronic; that can be treated in a non-emergency setting and not necessarily on the 
same day they are seen in the ED (pregnancy tests, toothache, minor cold, ingrown toenail). An applicable CPT code for this level of service would be 99281 (straight 
forward medical decision making).

To advance the health of our communities by ensuring 
quality emergency and disaster medical services 
I. Introduction 
 
 
Los Angeles County EMS Agency Mission Statement 
 
 
 
 
The Los Angeles County (LAC) Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency is 
responsible for monitoring and implementing regulatory oversight over for one of the 
largest multijurisdictional EMS systems in the nation. The LAC system utilizes more 
than 18,000 certified EMS personnel employed by public and private organizations, 
fire departments, ambulance companies, hospitals, and law enforcement agencies to 
provide emergency and non-emergency prehospital care to over 10 million residents 
and visitors. 
 
LAC requires a comprehensive quality improvement (QI) program to provide ongoing 
system evaluation to maintain quality in day-to-day operations while implementing 
process improvement strategies to advance patient care delivery that are consistent 
with best practices and evidence-based medicine. The QI plan provides the written 
framework for the QI program. 
 
Our system utilizes a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to drive improvement. 
It is educational, not punitive by design to encourage the exchange of information to 
enhance patient safety and minimize adverse events. Quality patient care delivery is 
sustained through ongoing evaluation, timely system feedback and education, in 
addition to, providing opportunities to acknowledge performance excellence within 
the system. 
 
The EMS Agency and QI program supports the California EMS Authority (EMSA) in 
the development, implementation, and reporting of statewide core measures. 
 
The LAC EMS QI plan is written in accordance with the California Code of Regulations, 
Title 22, Division 9, Chapter 12: Emergency Medical Services System Quality 
Improvement and is consistent with the State of California Emergency Medical 
Services System Quality Improvement Program Model Guidelines and EMSA 166, 
Appendix E, EMS Core Quality Measures.

III. Data Management 
A. Data Collection 
The EMS Agency obtains information through a variety of methods that include 
the following sources: electronic data exchange, hard copy review, internal and 
external customer surveys, and program reviews (audits). Data collection is 
primarily conducted via the Trauma and Emergency Medicine Information 
System (TEMIS), Lancet Technology Innovative Data Solutions by ESO. The 
TEMIS database assists the EMS Agency in evaluating, monitoring, and 
coordinating all EMS system components, as well as meet state data collection 
requirements. 
All public 9-1-1 and Exclusive Operating Area provider agencies utilize an 
electronic patient care record (ePCR) platform. Private (non-9-1-1) provider 
agencies, paramedic base hospitals and trauma centers utilizing paper PCR 
capture the required data elements using an approved electronic platform and 
standard paper forms (EMS Report Form, Base Hospital Form and Trauma 
Patient Summary Form). All paramedic base hospitals and trauma centers 
conduct data entry on site. The data is uploaded automatically to a dedicated 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site every 24 hours. 
Other mechanisms by which the EMS Agency obtains data include direct data 
input to the LA STEMI and LA Stroke databases by the designated SRC and 
stroke hospitals. Stroke data is also downloaded from the Get With The 
Guidelines (GWTG) Patient Management Tool. Helicopter EMS (HEMS) data is 
submitted to the EMS Agency on a quarterly basis from the three HEMS 
providers in LA County. The EMS Agency continues to work on the process of 
incorporating the STEMI, Stroke and HEMS data into TEMIS. Systemwide data 
collection on hospital diversion, bed availability, and surge capacity are 
collected via ReddiNet. 

Los Angeles County 
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2019/20 Quality Improvement Plan

2019/20 
 
 
 
 
The Public Safety Agency Data Registry allows public safety agencies approved 
for naloxone administration to enter data directly into the data registry. Each 
public safety agency may utilize the data registry to generate reports on their 
own agency to assist in the quality improvement process required 
for program approval. The EMS Agency oversees the data and will 
provide aggregate system reports. 
 
B. Data Validation 
Data submitted to the EMS Agency databases undergoes an extensive data 
quality review and clean up through the following mechanisms: 
 
1.  EMS Agency data entry personnel conduct monthly peer review data 
audits. Identified errors are corrected and overall data entry performance 
is included in the data entry personnel’s periodic performance evaluation 
report. 
 
2.  EMS provider agencies utilizing electronic data collection are required to 
validate their data using the EMS Agency’s published EMS Data 
Validator before submission to the FTP site. The EMS Agency conducts 
a secondary validation before final upload to TEMIS. Data that fails 
validation is rejected and sent back to the EMS Provider for correction. 
 
3.  Annual data audits are conducted by the EMS Agency for each EMS 
Provider Agency. A corrective action plan is required for data elements 
that fall below a 90% compliance rate for accuracy and completeness. 
 
4.  Data clean up reports are generated by the EMS Agency on a quarterly 
basis for Paramedic Base Hospitals and Trauma Centers. In general, a 
corrective action plan is required for data elements that fall below a 90% 
compliance rate for accuracy and completeness. 
 
5.  Documentation reports are routinely developed and disseminated in the 
quality improvement committees for evaluation and education on the 
application of the data dictionary and data standards to improve 
reliability. 
C. Data Submission 
1.  The EMS Agency ensures timely data collection and submission from 
base and trauma hospitals through written agreements. 
2.  Data collection requirements for other specialty care centers are 
prescribed in the specific specialty care center Standards and local 
policies. 

Los Angeles County 
Emergency Medical Services Agency 
2019/20 Quality Improvement Plan 
Page 9 of 17 
2019/20 
 
 
3.  EMS provider agency data collection requirements are governed by local 
policies. Submission of required data to the EMS Agency is highly 
dependent upon organizational resources (method of data collection/ 
 
ePCR vendor) and size (personnel/volume of EMS responses). The EMS 
Agency has established policies and procedures specific to submission of 
electronic patient care data. However, provider agencies experience 
vendor-related problems that cause significant delays in data submission 
to the EMS Agency. The EMS Agency and EMS community continue to 
work together on improving data collection and submission as the system 
transitions to the CEMSIS data requirements. 
4.  The LA County Trauma Center Programs participate in the American 
College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) and 
are members of the LA County TQIP Collaborative. Collaborative system- 
level TQIP reports allow us to compare our system performance to 
national results and impart opportunities for system-wide QI projects. 
 
5.  EMS providers may be required to submit self-reported data utilizing 
Excel spreadsheets for the following reasons: 
a.  Non-911 (interfacility) transports are not entered into TEMIS. 
 
b.  Base hospitals and public 911 provider agencies may be required 
to submit data on prospective QI projects when the required data 
cannot be accessed through the EMS Agency databases. 
 
c.   Provider agencies approved for a pilot project with an expanded 
local scope of practice requiring data not captured in the EMS 
Agency databases. 
 
d.  The EMS Agency is joining the Cardiac Arrest Registry to 
Enhance Survival (CARES) with data entry into CARES database 
beginning January 2021 for system benchmarking. 
 
D. Data Utilization 
1.  The EMS Agency utilizes the TEMIS, LA STEMI, LA Stroke, and GWTG 
databases for both statewide core measures and local system reports. 
The local reports are utilized for daily operations such as performance 
and contract monitoring, system audits, policy revision, and QI activities. 
The databases are also used to provide the information needed to 
analyze the potential impact of hospital diversions and closures. 
2.  Self-reported data utilizing Excel spreadsheets are utilized, when needed 
for private non-9-1-1 provider agency QI projects and evaluating 
performance and ensuring safety when new medications, treatment 
and/or devices are implemented into the system. 

Los Angeles County

2019/20 
 
 
3.  Public Safety Data Registry was implemented in May 2020 and will 
initially be utilized to evaluate the utilization of naloxone administered by 
approved public safety agencies. The plan is to expand the data registry 
to collect additional data regarding other field care provided by public 
safety agencies (i.e., tourniquet application and AED). 
 
E. Limitations 
1.  Separate Databases: The existence of multiple databases is not 
ideal for timely reporting. Multiple data entry and data abstraction are 
conducted on the same patient. Data analysis is resource-intensive 
when data elements are found in the various databases. 
2.  Multiple System Participants: Data validation and transmission is 
complex as more EMS provider agencies move toward utilizing various 
ePCR software applications. Changes to the reporting standards often 
require additional time and expense. 
3.  Data Quality: Current methods of data capture require extensive data 
audits. Cleanup is needed to ensure valid and reliable data. 
 
4.  Data Use Agreement (DUA): Meaningful evaluation of system 
performance is highly dependent on the collaboration amongst the 
participants, consensus on how data will be collected and utilized. 
Currently, the EMS Agency is only able to share a limited dataset with the 
EMS Authority without a DUA in place. A DUA would allow for an open 
and full exchange of data that can be used to expand the evaluation of 
system performance and improve delivery of care. 
 
IV. Quality Indicators 
A. Utilization of Provider Impression/New Treatment Protocols 
The new adult and pediatric Treatment Protocols (TP) utilizing Provider Impression 
(PI) codes were implemented in 2018 with systemwide transition complete in April 
2019. The EMS Public 9-1-1 Provider Agency and Base Hospital QI Committee 
assist the EMS Agency in evaluating the transition. Reference 1373, Medical 
Control Guideline: Treatment Protocol Quality Improvement Fallout Data Dictionary 
is a comprehensive tool developed to assist with standardizing the QI process. 
Link to Ref. No. 1373, TP QI Fallout Data Dictionary
 
 
 
B. Ambulance Patient Offload Time (APOT) 
The EMS Agency continues to work with the system participants to collect data 
using the Standardize Methods for Collecting and Reporting APOT data adopted by 
the EMS Authority. A workgroup has been convened to assist the EMS Agency in 
policy development to provide guidance in reducing 911 patient offload time. 
Members include representatives from the following organizations: Hospital 
Association of Southern California, Los Angeles County Ambulance Association, 
Emergency Nurses Association, Los Angeles County Professional Fire Fighter’s 
union, public (9-1-1) and private (non-911) provider agencies, and base hospitals.

C. EMSA Core Quality Measures 
The EMS Agency historically has participated in statewide data submission to 
CEMSIS and continues to actively participate in statewide data collection through 
the submission of core measure data outlined in EMSA #166, EMS Quality 
Improvement Program Guidelines/Core Quality Measures. To ensure reliable and 
valid data, the EMS Agency will continue to update our data dictionary and provide 
training/feedback to EMS personnel on documentation of the core measure data 
elements with the exception of ambulance response times by zones. The LAC EMS 
system is not designed to collect data by zones
. Alternatively, systemwide 
ambulance response times are collected and reported. 
 
D. COVID-19 
Early 2020 the EMS Agency implemented Reference No.1245, Potential COVID-19 
Patients and Reference No. 845, Treat and Refer for Mild Respiratory Illness 
During the COVID-19 Outbreak to guide treatment and transport decisions during 
the emerging pandemic. This required a change in our system performance 
indicators to evaluate the delivery of care for potential COVID-19 patients.. A 
dedicated webpage was established to enable timely access to current information 
on COVID-19 related hospital and prehospital data, PPE distribution, and 
educational resources. Additionally, the EMS Agency implemented weekly Zoom 
conference calls, led by the Medical Director, to provide the EMS community with 
information and updates on clinical and operational aspects that impact the delivery 
of prehospital care. Link to COVID Resources and Updates

V.   Prehospital Research 
Research provides an evidence base to support prehospital medical treatments and 
interventions. The EMS Agency actively supports prehospital research through the 
Research Data Collaboratives. Link to EMS System Publications 
 
VI. Evaluation of System Indicators 
A. The System EMS QI Coordinator and designated staff prepare reports on 
system performance indicators to be utilized by the QI Team, Advisory 
Committees, and EMS Commission to ensure systemwide evaluation. 
 
B. Under the direction of the EMS Agency Medical Director, the EMS Agency QI 
Team will analyze system reports generated by each EMS Agency section 
responsible for reporting on current performance indicators and EMS Authority 
Core Measures. 
 
C. Presentations on performance indicators will be prepared in the most 
appropriate format to allow for ease of interpretation of data. Formats most 
commonly utilized include line charts, bar graphs, flowcharts, and data tables.

VII. Action to Improve 
 
A.   The EMS Agency, under the direction of the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, utilizes the FOCUS PDSA model for performance improvement. 
 
1. Find a process to improve; improvement needs are identified by the EMS 
Agency QI Team in collaboration with the TAG, QI and Advisory groups. 
2. Organize the process utilizing the team most familiar with the process related to 
the system process identified. 
3. Clarify current knowledge of the process by collecting information and reviewing 
current trends. 
4. Understand capabilities and causes for variations in processes by utilizing 
brainstorming techniques and fishbone diagrams or flowcharts. 
5. Select a strategy or process for improvement that will most likely reduce or 
eliminate the causes for variation in performance. 
6. Plan, determine objectives and develop plan in agreement with system 
participants. 
7. Do, carry out the action according to established plan. 
8. Study findings, the EMS QI Team with system input will analyze the findings, 
compare with hypothesis, and prepare a summary for a trend report. 
9. Act on findings, the EMS QI Team in collaboration with the TAG, QI and 
Advisory groups will determine performance improvement needs. A Quality 
Task Force may be chartered if needed, to carry out specific performance 
improvement plans. 
 
 
VIII. Training and Education 
 
A. The effectiveness of the QI process is related to the efficacy of training and 
educational activities. Due the size and complexity of our system, training and 
education is accomplished through a variety of mechanisms: 
1. Quality Improvement Committees/Advisory Meetings 
Information needed for improving local system and statewide 
performance is disseminated to committee members for training and 
education of providers responsible for direct patient care.

2. EMS Update 
Under the direction of Dr. Denise Whitfield, the EMS Agency staff, 
Paramedic Training Institute, and system stakeholders develop and 
implement the mandatory annual EMS Update that address educational 
and training needs related to performance improvement. The EMS 
Update 2020 format was changed to an on-line format utilizing a learning 
management system. 
3. EMS Data Report 
The EMS Agency publishes an annual data report that provides valuable 
feedback to the EMS community and citizens of Los Angeles on system 
demographics and performance. 
Link to LAC EMS System Report 
 
4.  
The Emergi-Press is a web-based EMS educational forum located on the 
EMS Agency website. Educational material includes, ECG of the month 
video learning modules, and cases from the field that are posted monthly 
with availability to earn continuing education credit. Additionally, the 
Emergi-Press utilizes Updates from The Medical Director to communicate 
pertinent information to EMS personnel and stakeholders regarding 
system issues. Link to Emergi-Press, current and past
 
 
B. The EMS Agency QI Team and other advisory groups review policies and 
procedures to insure consistency with the EMSA and LAC EMS QI plan. 
C. Once a performance improvement plan has been successfully implemented, the 
EMS Agency will post all policies and system updates to its website to allow 
timely access by all EMS participants. 
VIII. Update/Summary 
The QI plan was updated to reflect the changes in our plan and performance 
measures. Year 2020 required the EMS Agency to focus efforts on evaluating COVID- 
19 related Provider Impressions, utilization of Treatment Protocol Reference No. 1245, 
Potential COVID-19 Patient, Reference No.834, Patient Refusal of Treatment or 
Transport, and Reference No. 845, Treat and Refer for Mild Respiratory Illness During 
the COVID-19 Outbreak. An ad hoc committee with community partners was convened 
to evaluate the EMS Agency data and improve prehospital care for patients not 
transported. The QI plan is submitted to EMSA for review and published on the EMS 
Agency website for review by the EMS participants and system stakeholders.
