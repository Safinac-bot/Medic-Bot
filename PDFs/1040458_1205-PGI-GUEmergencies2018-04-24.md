a surgical emergency and must be taken as a sign of a life-threatening condition. These patients 
need rapid transport to the closest EDAP. 
 
❷   For both upper and lower GI bleeding, if abdominal pain is also present, document GI bleeding as   
primary provider impression and abdominal pain as secondary provider impression.
