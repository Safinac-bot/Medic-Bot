EFFECTIVE DATE: 10-01-16                                                              PAGE 1 OF 1

Medical Control Guideline: PERFUSION STATUS 
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. Perfusion status is determined by a combination of parameters that includes heart rate, 
blood pressure, tissue color and mentation.  No one parameter alone can be used to 
determine perfusion status. 
 
2. Adequate perfusion is defined as adequate circulation of blood through organs and 
tissues, manifested by normal pulse, tissue color, level of consciousness and blood 
pressure. 
 
3. Poor perfusion is defined as inadequate circulation of blood through organs and tissues 
manifested by vital sign abnormalities and/or signs and symptoms of organ dysfunction. 
 
4. Patients with poor perfusion that are unresponsive to initial fluid resuscitation are in 
shock. 
 
GUIDELINES: 
 
1. EMS providers should evaluate adult patients for the following signs and use clinical 
judgment to determine poor perfusion status: 
 
a. Bradycardia, tachycardia and/or poor pulse quality (weak/thready) 
 
b. Altered mental status (including anxiety, restlessness, lethargy, combative behavior) 
 
c. Adult systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90mmHg 
 
d. Delayed capillary refill time (> 2 seconds) and/or changes in tissue color including 
pallor, cyanosis, or mottling 
 
2. For pediatric patients, EMS providers should determine a patient to have poor 
perfusion if they exhibit altered mental status (including lethargy or agitation) with one or 
more of the following: 
 
a. Mottling, cyanosis, or flushed redness 
 
b. Bradycardia or tachycardia per MCG 1309 
 
c. Hypotension relative to size per MCG 1309 
 
d. Delayed capillary refill >2 seconds or flash capillary refill <1 second
