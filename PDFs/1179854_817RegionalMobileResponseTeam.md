PURPOSE:     To establish a formal mechanism for providing rapid advanced emergency  
 medical care at the scene in which a higher level of on-scene emergency medical 
expertise, physician field response, is requested by the on-scene prehospital 
care provider.   
 
AUTHORITY:  Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1798. (a)   
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
9-1-1 Jurisdictional Provider: The local governmental agency that has jurisdiction over a 
defined geographic area for the provision of prehospital emergency medical care. In 
general, these are cities and fire districts that have been defined in accordance with the 
Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.201. 
 
Exclusive Operating Area (EOA) Provider: Prehospital emergency medical 
transportation agencies/companies that have the exclusive rights to provide emergency 
9-1-1 medical transportation in predefined geographic areas. These include cities and 
ambulance companies that have exclusive emergency transportation rights as defined by 
the Health and Safety Code, Division 2.5, Section 1797.201 and Section 1797.224, and 
referenced in the Los Angeles County EMS Plan. 
 
Fire Operational Area Coordinator (FOAC): Los Angeles County Fire Department is the 
FOAC for the County, which is contacted through its Dispatch Center. 
 
Hospital Emergency Response Team (HERT): Organized group of health care providers 
from a designated Level I Trauma Center, with Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency 
approval as a HERT provider, who are available 24 hours/day to respond and provide a 
higher level of on-scene surgical and medical expertise. 
 
Incident Commander: The highest-ranking official of the jurisdictional agency at the scene 
of the incident and responsible for the overall management of the incident. 
 
Medical Alert Center (MAC): Serves as the control point for the VMED28 and ReddiNet® 
systems and the point of contact when a HERT is requested. The MAC shall contact an 
approved HERT provider based on the incident location. 
  
Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU): Organized group of health care providers with highly specialized 
equipment associated with a designated Comprehensive Stroke Center, who are available to 
respond and provide a higher level on-scene stroke care. A MSU is approved by the EMS

Physician Field Response: Is a situation in which a higher level of on-scene emergency 
medical or surgical expertise is warranted due to the nature of the emergency and requested 
by the on-scene prehospital care provider. 
 
Qualified Specialist: A physician licensed in the State of California who is Board Certified 
or Board Eligible in the corresponding specialty by American Board of Medical Specialties 
(ABMS) or American Osteopathic Association (AOA). 
 
Standard Precautions: Is a combination of the major features of Universal Precautions (UP) 
and Body Substance Isolation (BSI). Standard Precautions include a group of infection 
prevention practices that apply to all patients, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection 
status, in any setting in which healthcare is delivered. These include: hand hygiene, use of 
gloves, gown, mask, eye protection, or face shield, depending on the anticipated exposure; 
and safe injection practices. 
 
VMED28: The VMED28 frequency is the primary method of communications with paramedic 
providers to coordinate patient destination activities with the Medical Alert Center (MAC). 
The VMED28 also serves as a back-up communication system for intra-hospital 
communication and between hospitals and the MAC.
