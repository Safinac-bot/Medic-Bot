Base Hospital Contact: Required for respiratory failure, severe respiratory distress unresponsive 
or not amenable to CPAP. 
 
1. Use appropriate PPE ❶ 
 
2. Assess airway and initiate basic and/or advanced airway maneuvers prn (MCG 1302) ❷ ❸

4. Administer Oxygen prn (MCG 1302) 
High flow Oxygen 15 L/min for all patients with impending respiratory failure, suspected 
pneumothorax, inhalation injury, or carbon monoxide exposure 
 
5. If patient with stridor, obstruction or tracheostomy concerns, treat per TP 1234, Airway Obstruction 
 
6. If pulmonary edema/CHF exacerbation suspected, treat per TP 1214, Pulmonary Edema/CHF 
 
7. If anaphylaxis suspected, treat in conjunction with TP 1219, Allergy 
 
8. Initiate CPAP for alert patients with moderate or severe respiratory distress. ❺ 
Hold CPAP for patients with hypotension, suspected pneumothorax, upper airway 
edema/obstruction or other contraindications (MCG 1315) 
 
9. Capnography is encouraged for patients with moderate or severe respiratory distress (MCG1305) 
❻ 
 
10. Initiate cardiac monitoring prn (MCG 1308) 
Perform 12-lead ECG if cardiac ischemia suspected and treat in conjunction with                           
TP 1211, Cardiac Chest Pain 
 
11. Consider the following etiologies of respiratory distress without pulmonary edema: 
Bronchospasm (asthma or COPD) – document Provider Impression as Respiratory Distress / 
Bronchospasm 
Pneumonia – document Provider Impression as Respiratory Distress / Other 
Pulmonary embolism – document Provider Impression as Respiratory Distress / Other 
Spontaneous pneumothorax – document Provider Impression as Respiratory Distress / Other 
 
12. For bronchospasm, COPD or asthma exacerbation:  
Albuterol 5mg (6mL) via neb or 4 puffs via MDI ❼❽ 
May repeat x2 prn wheezing  
May be administered in-line with CPAP for patients with moderate or severe respiratory distress 
Document Provider Impression as Respiratory Distress / Bronchospasm 
 
For deteriorating respiratory status despite albuterol: 
Epinephrine (1mg/mL) administer 0.5mg (0.5mL) IM 
Consider early in asthma exacerbation with poor perfusion or severe respiratory distress ❾ 
Unlikely to benefit patients with COPD exacerbation

13. Establish vascular access prn (MCG 1375) 
 
14. For poor perfusion (MCG 1355):  
Normal Saline 1L IV rapid infusion  
Reassess after each 250mL increment for evidence of volume overload (pulmonary edema); stop 
infusion if pulmonary edema develops 
 
For persistent poor perfusion, treat in conjunction with TP 1207, Shock/Hypotension 
 
15. If sepsis suspected, treat in conjunction with TP 1204, Fever/Sepsis 
 
16. If overdose is suspected, treat in conjunction with TP 1241, Overdose/Poisoning/Ingestion 
 
17. If inhalation injury suspected, treat in conjunction with TP 1236, Inhalation Injury 
 
18. Perform needle thoracostomy for suspected tension pneumothorax (MCG 1335)

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
❶   Consider wearing surgical mask when caring for patients with respiratory distress of unclear etiology, 
which may be infectious. 
 
❷   Initiate BMV to assess patient response. Effective BMV may improve the patient’s respiratory status 
enough to restore adequate spontaneous respirations.  Place advanced airway if BMV is ineffective or 
consider placement once assessment for rapidly reversible causes is complete. Paramedics should 
use judgment based on patient characteristics, circumstances, and skill level when selecting the 
advanced airway modality.   
 
❸   If positive pressure ventilation is performed at any time, document Provider Impression as Respiratory 
Arrest / Respiratory Failure  
 
❹   Fowler’s or Semi-Fowler’s positioning is likely to be most comfortable for awake patients with  
      respiratory distress. 
 
❺ Early use of CPAP has been shown to decrease ICU length of stay and risk of intubation for patients 
with severe respiratory distress. It should be strongly considered for patients in moderate-to-severe 
respiratory distress, based on assessment of work of breathing, regardless of SpO
2
. CPAP is 
appropriate for undifferentiated respiratory distress. It is the treatment of choice for patients with 
COPD exacerbation and may be used in conjunction with albuterol or if patient does not improve after 
initial albuterol.  
 
❻ Persistently high or increasing end-tidal CO
2
 (EtCO
2
) readings above normal with low respiratory rate 
indicate respiratory failure (bradypneic hypoventilation); low EtCO
2
 readings with a low respiratory rate 
also may represent respiratory failure due to low tidal volumes (hypopneic hypoventilation); consider 
the need for assisted ventilations in these cases. In a patient with respiratory distress of unclear 
etiology, a “shark-fin” capnography waveform indicates likely Bronchospasm/COPD exacerbation. 
Gradually elevating EtCO
2
 waveforms (“stacking”) in a patient with BMV indicates excessive 
ventilation by the provider, resulting in inadequate exhalation; in this case, decrease ventilation rate 
significantly to avoid progression to cardiopulmonary arrest. 
  
❼ Wheezing may also be caused by pulmonary edema; reassess breath sounds frequently for patients 
without history of asthma or with other concerns for volume overload (edema, etc.), because as air 
entry improves with treatment, rales may be more easily heard.  If pulmonary edema/CHF 
exacerbation suspected, treat per TP 1214, Pulmonary Edema/CHF. 
 
❽ Administration of albuterol via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer is considered equivalent to 
nebulized albuterol; a spacer is typically required for this route to be effective in novice users. MDIs 
are single use and should be left with the hospital staff upon handoff of the patient. 
 
❾  Epinephrine may be administered prior to albuterol as initial drug therapy in patients with Respiratory 
Failure due to bronchospasm.
