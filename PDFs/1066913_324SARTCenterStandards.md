PURPOSE: To establish minimum standards for the designation of Sexual Assault Response 
Team (SART) Centers. The SART Centers provide care to victims of sexual 
assault, sexual exploitation, and/or human trafficking by meeting specific 
requirements for professional staff, quality improvement, education, support 
services, equipment, supplies, medications, and established policies and 
procedures. 
  
The goal of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Agency is 
to transport these patients to a SART Center, where healthcare practitioners have 
special training in treating victims of sexual assault/abuse and in the collection of 
forensic evidence. 
 
DEFINITIONS: 
 
Board Certified (BC): Successful completion of the evaluation process through one of the Member 
Boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) or American Osteopathic Association 
(AOA), including an examination designed to assess the knowledge, skills, and experience 
necessary to provide quality patient care in a particular specialty. 
 
Board Eligible (BE): Successful completion of a residency program with progression to board 
certification based on the time frame specified by the ABMS or AOA. 
 
California Governor’s Office of Emergency Service (Cal OES): Cal OES Public Safety Division 
provides funding to programs that train law enforcement, court education, victim notification, 
victim/witness assistance, reducing crime lab backlogs, and post-conviction DNA testing. Cal OES 
has developed the standardized forensic-medical forms which must be used to document the 
sexual assault examination. 
 
Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC): Any range of crimes and activities involving 
the sexual abuse or exploitation of a child for the financial benefit of any person or in exchange for 
anything of value (including monetary and non-monetary benefits) given or received by any person. 
https://dcfs.lacounty.gov/youth/sexual-exploitation/ 
 
Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS): A mandated component of Emergency 
Response Services, administered by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family 
Services. The Child Protection Hotline (CPH), (800) 540-4000, intake evaluation staff is responsible 
for assessing any referral, whether verbal or written, which alleges child abuse, neglect, sexual 
assault, or exploitation, which includes commercial sexual exploitation and human trafficking, to 
determine whether an in-person investigation and consultation is required. 
 
Patient: A person who has been sexually assaulted, commercially sexually exploited, or human 
trafficked. The patient can also be identified as the victim and/or survivor. In the criminal justice 
system, the patient is identified as a crime victim. For rape crisis centers providing counseling and 
advocacy, the patient is identified as a survivor.
