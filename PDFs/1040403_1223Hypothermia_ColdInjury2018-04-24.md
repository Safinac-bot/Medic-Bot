1. Assess airway and initiate basic and/or advanced airway maneuvers prn (MCG 1302) 
 
2. Administer Oxygen prn (MCG 1302) 
 
3. Initiate cardiac monitoring (MCG 1308) 
For patients with dysrhythmias, treat in conjunction with TP 1212, Bradycardia or                        
TP 1213, Tachycardia 
 
4. Provide warming measures ❶ 
 
5. For frostbite: 
Handle affected area gently, remove jewelry, cover and protect the area ❷ 
 
6. Establish vascular access prn (MCG 1375) 
 
7. For altered level of consciousness, treat in conjunction with TP 1229, ALOC 
 
8. For poor perfusion (MCG 1355): 
Normal Saline 1L IV rapid infusion; use warm saline if available 
Reassess after each 250 mL increment for evidence of volume overload (pulmonary edema); 
stop infusion if pulmonary edema develops 
 
For persistent poor perfusion, treat in conjunction with TP 1207, Shock/Hypotension 
 
9. For cardiac arrest, treat in conjunction with TP 1210, Cardiac Arrest  
Initiate rewarming while resuscitation is ongoing ❸

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
❶   Warming measures should include moving the patient to a warm environment as quickly as 
possible, removing wet clothing/items, covering with an emergency/rescue blanket or 
blanket/sheets, and using warm normal saline if available.  
 
❷    Do not allow an area of frostbite to thaw and then refreeze as this causes more tissue damage. 
 
❸    Follow usual protocols for resuscitation of patients with hypothermic cardiac arrest while rewarming. 
Patients with hypothermia may have good neurologic outcome despite prolonged resuscitation; 
resuscitative efforts should continue until the patient is rewarmed.  Consultation with the Base 
Physician is required before consideration of termination of resuscitation.
