DEFINITION: 
 
Pilot or Scientific Study:  For the purposes of this policy, a pilot or scientific study is an 
evaluation of an intervention (i.e., medication, device, protocol, or other treatment) that is 
prospectively tested in a study population. Testing may include the introduction or withholding of 
the proposed intervention. 
 
Investigator(s): The individual or team of individuals that is leading the pilot or scientific study.   
 
Institutional Review Board: The Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee responsible for 
reviewing and approving all human subjects research to ensure the welfare of the participants is 
protected.  
 
PRINCIPLES: 
 
1. All pilot or scientific studies must be submitted for review and approval by the EMS 
Agency Medical Director or designee prior to implementation. 
 
2. The EMS Agency Medical Director may approve or conduct a pilot or scientific study 
evaluating the safety, feasibility, and/or efficacy of the prehospital medication, device, 
protocol, or other treatment within the local EMS system involving EMTs and/or 
paramedics. The study shall be consistent with any requirements established by the 
California EMS Authority for pilot or scientific studies conducted within the prehospital 
emergency medical care system, and, where applicable, with the California Health and 
Safety Code, Division 104, Part 5, Chapter 6, Article 5, Section 111550-111610. 
 
3. No medication, device, protocol, or other treatment that is specifically excluded by the 
California EMS Authority from use in the EMS system shall be included in a pilot or 
scientific study without the approval of the EMS Agency Medical Director and the 
California EMS Authority. 
 
4. Any pilot or scientific study using data or information under the authority of, or maintained 
and managed by, the EMS Agency must be approved by the EMS Agency Director and 
Medical Director prior to implementation.

5. When applicable, IRB approval will be required prior to implementation of a pilot or 
scientific study at the discretion of the EMS Agency Medical Director. 
 
6. Requests for implementation of procedures and/or medications currently approved for 
local additional scope or optional use within Los Angeles County are not subject to this 
policy. Such requests will be processed as identified per Los Angeles County Scope of 
Practice policies (Ref. No. 802 and 803) and applicable approved unit inventory policies.
